<p>Here is a listing of all of the blog posts I currently have hosted on this site. I have in the past used other blogs - many of them. However, to make things simpler for everyone, I'm defaulting down to this blog for now, for all new posts. This blog is <i>not</i> a simple, cut-and-dry, one-topic journal. It was never meant to be.</p>

<p>You can see posts arranged by tags <a href="{{ BASE_PATH }}/tags">here</a>. Here is <a href="https://www.burntfen.com/feed.xml">the RSS Feed</a>.</p>
