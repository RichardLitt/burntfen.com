I am on the executive committee for the Postgraduate Student Association (PGSA) at Te Herenga Waka Victoria University of Wellington. I'd already been helping out in my first year as an advisor, and I was very pleased that someone else stepped up to be the president of PGSA. PGSA largely does events and some advocacy. I help where I can.
