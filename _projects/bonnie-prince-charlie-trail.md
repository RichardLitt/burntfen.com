Bonnie Prince Charlie infamously lead the 1745 Jacobite Rebellion in Scotland, ending at the Battle of Culloden on April 16th. From there, he fled with some loyal retainers to the west coast of Scotland, where he took ship to the Hebrides. There’s a trail for the Bonnie Prince Charlie trek there - but there isn’t one from Culloden.

So, I walked the flight path of Bonnie Prince Charlie from Culloden to Loch nan Uamh in April, 2022. My support crew was Kyle Smith, of [Carbon Zerow](/projects/carbon-zerow), who would have joined me if not for a late case of COVID. We're hoping to do this next year, too.
