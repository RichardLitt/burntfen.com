[NodeSchool](http://nodeschool.io) is an autonomous, distributed system of coding camps meant to help teach people how to use Node.js, a JavaScript framework. I organized the first Nodeschool in <a href="http://nodeschool.io/chiang-mai/">Chiang Mai, Thailand</a>, co-organized the first Nodeschool in <a href="http://nodeschool.io/bali/">Bali, Indonesia</a>, and have mentored Nodeschool and NodeSummit workshops in <a href="http://nodeschool.io/sanfrancisco">San Francisco</a>.
