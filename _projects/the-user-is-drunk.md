The User Is Drunk is a UX/UI consultancy website, with a twist: I review sites while under the influence of alcohol. The site went viral: it hit the top of Hacker News, gathered 100k hits in the first week, and generated over 50+ clients, including some major companies like Hubspot, Gizmodo, and VWO.

I wrote a retrospective on Medium that got over 100 recommends: [The User Has Sobered Up](https://medium.com/@richlitt/the-user-has-sobered-up-df0b411997ea#.zbdpg4f1t), and [this post](https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/78184134-10-things-i-learned-about-ux-by-being-drunk) on Shopify's blog about some tips concerning UX.
