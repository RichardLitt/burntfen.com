I maintain and contribute to several awesome-* lists on GitHub. "Awesome" lists, started by _[Sindre Sorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus)_, are collaboratively built lists of things that are, well, awesome. They have helped change how the GitHub community curates its ecosystem, allowing for easier entry and recall of important links.

On GitHub, users can 'star' repositories to show that they like them and to bookmark them for later use. The stars below are a good metric for user engagement with these lists.

My lists:

- [awesome-conferences ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/RichardLitt/awesome-conferences.svg)](https://github.com/RichardLitt/awesome-conferences) _Creator_
- [awesome-styleguides ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/RichardLitt/awesome-styleguides.svg)](https://github.com/RichardLitt/awesome-styleguides) _Creator_
- [awesome-fantasy ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/RichardLitt/awesome-fantasy.svg)](https://github.com/RichardLitt/awesome-fantasy) _Creator_
- [awesome-scifi ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/sindresorhus/awesome-scifi.svg)](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome-scifi) _Main maintainer: originally started by [@sindresorhus](https://github.com/sindresorhus)_  
- [awesome-ipfs ![GitHub stars](https://img.shields.io/github/stars/ipfs/awesome-ipfs.svg)](https://github.com/ipfs/awesome-ipfs) _Creator: Maintained by [the IPFS team](https://github.com/ipfs)_

Two other lists fit the awesome criteria, but have their own pages: [git-flight-rules](../git-flight-rules) and [endangered-languages](../endangered-languages).
