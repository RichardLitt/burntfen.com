I advised [Mike Raznick](https://mikeraznick.com/), a composer and audio director, by creating a language for some goblin-esque characters in a video game called Mirandus. The game never made it to release, sadly, as the work was really fun. The language was made to be harsh and unique, with some strange phonological choices. I was very happy with how the voice actors dealt with it. You can see some of it featured in this video, below, at 22 seconds in.
