I'm hosting the first Montréal Silent Book Club meeting. It's a party for introverts; bring a book, don't talk to anyone, have a good time. I contacted [Drawn and Quarterly](https://www.drawnandquarterly.com/) about using their space, and they kindly obliged. I didn't come up the SBC - it's been around in over 40 cities. But I did start it in Montréal. I also got interviewed on the radio on CBC Daybreak about it, which was pretty cool.
