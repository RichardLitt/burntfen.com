I maintain and fill out a list of procedures on GitHub to try when one is lost using git, a popular versioning system for code. This list was originally started by _Kate Hudson_. It was one of the main sources used by my friend _[Ricardo Magalh√£es](http://firstaidgit.io)_ for [firstaidgit.io](http://firstaidgit.io/).

This list is similar to the [awesome-*](../awesome) lists I maintain on GitHub.
