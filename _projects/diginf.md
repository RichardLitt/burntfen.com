I helped facilitate a community of researchers and practitioners working to better understand the problem of what is digital infrastructure, and how it underpins our world. The two million dollar fund was funded by the Ford Foundation, Sloan, Open Society, Mozilla, Open Collective, and Omidyar Network. I ended my tenure here by holding an event at the Ford Foundation building in New York City on May 11th, 2023. 

As part of this work, I also hosted the [Digital Infrastructure Fund Podcast](https://dif.fireside.fm/).
