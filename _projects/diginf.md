I help facilitate a community of researchers and practitioners to better understand the problem of what is digital infrastructure, and to work together toward our common goal: a commons of technology, sustainably developed and maintained, for the benefit of everyone.

I also host the [Digital Infrastructure Fund Podcast](https://dif.fireside.fm/).
