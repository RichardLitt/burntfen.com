I helped organize FOSS Responders, a volunteer group with people from all over the tech world to help out anyone in the FLOSS ecosystem who has been affected by COVID-19. Together, we raised over $100k for open source projects and individuals, and helped disburse it. One of the main things I did here is to help build the website.
