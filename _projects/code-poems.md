[Code Poems](http://code-poems.com/) was a project to print a small edition of books of code poetry. I submitted a couple of poems, and one of them got selected. Here is my entry:

    # Richard Littauer
    # This script should save lives.

    import soul

    for days in len(life):
      print "happiness"

    '''
    The-Notebook:~ richard$ python import_soul.py
    Traceback (most recent call last):
