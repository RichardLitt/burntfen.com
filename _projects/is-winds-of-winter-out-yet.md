This was probably my most useful site, on whether GRR Martin has published his next book in the _Game of Thrones_ series yet, originally located at http://iswindsofwinteroutyet.com. I bought and made this as a joke, and it served admirably at that role. I decided to stop paying $15 a year for the honor of owning this site in 2020. Let someone else take up the torch.
