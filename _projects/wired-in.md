I led a team of six in the Erasmus Mundi Alumni Association's incubator, [Realise It](http://www.em-a.eu/en/ema-activities/realise-it.html), building a time keeper and task organiser. The prototype was based on a tool I had built while a student at Saarland University, in Germany, on an Erasmus Mundus scholarship, working towards my MSc in Computational Linguistics.
