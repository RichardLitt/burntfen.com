I write a column occasionally for the local newspaper, The Bridge. The column is called [The Way I See It](https://montpelierbridge.org/category/columns/the-way-i-see-it/), and is shared with other columnists. Here's a list of what has been published so far:

* [More Than Meets The Eye: A Birder's Journey](https://montpelierbridge.org/2022/03/the-way-i-see-it-more-than-meets-the-eye-a-birders-journey/)
* [Growing Roots Through Wings](https://montpelierbridge.org/2022/07/the-way-i-see-it-growing-roots-through-wings/)
* [The Cannons on the Lawn](https://montpelierbridge.org/2022/11/the-way-i-see-it-the-cannons-on-the-lawn/)
* [How I Name What I See](https://montpelierbridge.org/2023/03/the-way-i-see-it-how-i-name-what-i-see/)

I've also been in a couple of articles, like [this one](https://montpelierbridge.org/2020/03/birders-welcomed-beyond-no-trespassing-signs/) on birding and [this one](https://montpelierbridge.org/2020/02/sorsha-anderson-plays-shakespeares-liveliest-heroine/) on Shakespeare.
