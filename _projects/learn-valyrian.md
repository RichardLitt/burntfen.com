I ran this twitter account to build hype for Valyrian, a language from GRR Martin's _Game of Thrones_. A few months after creating it, it was announced that David Peterson would create it for the HBO series, and I subsequently closed the account.

I also have the novelty Twitter account [@AynRandAlThor](https://twitter.com/AynRandAlThor), for people who liked Robert Jordan's _The Wheel of Time_ and also like Ayn Rand (or don't).

This is somewhat related to my [Dothraki](../dothraki) and [Na'vi](../learn-navi) work.
