I serve on the [Node.js i18n Working Group](https://github.com/nodejs/i18n), and have also served on the [Node.js Community Committee](http://github.com/nodejs/community-committee) as a member in 2017. I've been part of the Node community for many years, and this is part of how I give back to the awesome people and project who have helped me out as a JavaScript developer over the years.
