[Nomad as Fuck](https://nomadasfuck.netlify.app/) is a project I ran, highlighting awesome nomads and talking about some of their stories. This was born out of my desire to talk about all of the cool people I was meeting through Hacker Paradise, a remote coworker community I was a part of. I've been lucky enough to know a lot of nomads and to travel a lot, so this is my way of highlighting the ecosystem and talking about nomadism more, just like [Antinomadic](../antinomadic/), which was the antithesis of this project.

This used to be at nomadasfuck.com, but paying for domain names is onerous for past projects. I've now archived it and am hosting it only on Netlify.
