[Nomad as Fuck](http://nomadasfuck.com) is a project I run, highlighting awesome nomads and talking about some of their stories. I've been lucky enough to know a lot of nomads and to travel a lot, so this is my way of highlighting the ecosystem and talking about nomadism more, just like [Antinomadic](../antinomadic/).
