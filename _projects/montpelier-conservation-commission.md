I sit on the Montpelier Conservation Commission Conservation Fund Advisory Board, which means that every months I meet with a few other people to discuss how to help advise the Conservation Commission on how to spend the money the town has allocated towards helping conserve land in Montpelier. The MCCCFAB has managed in the past couple of years to help conserve and protect [another 80 acres for Hubbard Park](https://montpelierbridge.org/2021/11/hubbard-park-inches-closer-to-80-acre-expansion/), which is great.
