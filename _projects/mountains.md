I like to climb mountains a lot. There is often no deliverable for this effort, or photos, or consumable item. But there is joy, and memories. 

I log most of my ascents on [Peakbagger](https://peakbagger.com/climber/climber.aspx?cid=31159), a website for sharing lists of mountains and climbs. I am focusing mainly on [the 3000' mountains in Vermont](https://peakbagger.com/List.aspx?lid=-938395&cid=31159), at the moment, although I have a few other lists I enjoy working on - all of the [Scottish Munros](https://peakbagger.com/List.aspx?lid=5521&cid=31159), for instance, or the [high points all of the United States](https://peakbagger.com/List.aspx?lid=12003&cid=31159).

As well as individual peaks, I also enjoy long-distance hiking. I've hiked the West Highland Way, the Great Glen Way, and [the Long Trail](https://www.greenmountainclub.org/the-long-trail/). I have also done several other long distance hikes, such as [the Bonnie Prince Charlie Trail](https://www.burntfen.com/projects/bonnie-prince-charlie-trail/), and I've canoed the length of the Allagash River in Maine. I am a member of the [Green Mountain Club](https://www.greenmountainclub.org/), and enjoy being a trail angel when I am able.

Hiking and bushwhacking with others is a joy of mine. Get in touch. If you're on a long distance hike, let me know how I can support you.
