I cohost the [Sustain](https://sustain.codefund.fm) podcast on what it means to sustain open source software development for the long term. We shine the spotlight on people to help their projects to grow and evolve. We also focus on structuring code and organizations to support the efforts of open source contributors.

This podcast grew out of the [SustainOSS conference](https://sustainoss.org/), which is now in its third year, and which I help organize, as well.
