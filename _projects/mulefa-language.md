I worked with Bad Wolf to create a Mulefa language for the HBO/BBC series _His Dark Materials_, based on the Phillip Pullman novels. I created a working language and translated lines as needed for the elephantine creatures in the third season. I was also able to go to the studios in Cardiff and meet some of the actors, which was quite fun.

You can see the episodes I am listed in on the [IMDB page](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm14473746/).
