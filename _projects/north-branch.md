I [served on the board](https://northbranchnaturecenter.org/team-page/) at the North Branch Nature Center, a 501(c)3 charity dedicated to nature in my hometown of Montpelier, Vermont. The Nature Center has some wonderful fields, trails, and a variety of great nature programs. I helped here and there with what I could, like installing and monitoring a microphone to record all of the nocturnal flight calls from migrating bird during the spring and fall, leading bird walks, and serving on various committees as a board member.
