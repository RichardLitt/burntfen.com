I serve on the board at the North Branch Nature Center in my hometown of Montpelier, Vermont. The Nature Center has some wonderful fields, trails, and a variety of great nature programs. I help here and there with what I can, like installing and monitoring a microphone to record all of the nocturnal flight calls from migrating bird during the spring and fall.
