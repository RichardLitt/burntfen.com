I am one of the committee members for [PythonNZ](https://python.nz/), a community of Python users in Aotearoa New Zealand. We hold meetups and host an annual event called KiwiPycon. While I don't use Python in everything, I do use it almost every day I am on a computer, and it is great to be able to support and be a member of a local tech community.

I gave a talk at the first KiwiPycon I attended, in 2024, on iNaturalist and eBird. You can watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KkQEzmOOBY&t=1s).

I am helping to organize [Kiwi PyCon 2025](https://kiwipycon.nz/). You should come!
