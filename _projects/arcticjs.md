I attended [ArcticJS](http://arcticjs.club), the first JavaScript conference above the Arctic circle. Started as a pseudo-joke by some hackers travelling around Europe (in particular, [@feross](//twitter.com/feross), [@mafintosh](//twitter.com/mafintosh),  and [@wa7son](//twitter.com/wa7son)), this swiftly spiralled out of control, and 13 participants came to Svalbard to talk about JS and enjoy the long night. 

I gave a talk about `$ git yolo`, just as I did at BrooklynJS in November. I also helped organize the conference, helping with logistics and so on. It was mad fun. (I am currently writing this from the northernmost church in the world, where I am watching a talk, actually.)
