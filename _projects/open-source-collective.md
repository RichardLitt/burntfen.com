The Open Source Collective is a non-profit umbrella organisation (501c6) providing financial and legal infrastructure for over three thousand open source projects, and counting. It is part of the [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/) project, which is making it easier for people to send and receive money as a collective without having to jump through modern banking hoops.

I helped serve the needs of open source projects, by providing resources, enabling fund transfer, and building a community of open source developers.

I'd been working with Open Collective for years when I started this - largely with [Sustain](/projects/sustain) and the [Digital Infrastructure Fund](/projects/diginf/), which I ran as part of this work. I decided in 2023 to focus my efforts on Sustain and parted ways to focus more there.
