The Open Source Collective is a non-profit umbrella organisation (501c6) providing financial and legal infrastructure for over three thousand open source projects, and counting. It is part of the [Open Collective](https://opencollective.com/) project, which is making it easier for people to send and receive money as a collective without having to jump through modern banking hoops.

I am helping us figure out how to best serve the needs of open source projects, by providing resources, enabling fund transfer, and building a community of open source developers. Together, we're influencing the entire field of open source.

I've been working with Open Collective for years - largely with [Sustain](/projects/sustain) and the [Digital Infrastructure Fund](/projects/diginf/), which I run as part of this work.
