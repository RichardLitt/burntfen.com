I contribute regularly to iNaturalist and eBird, two large citizen science databases that catalogue life. Here is [my eBird profile](https://ebird.org/profile/Mjg0MTUx/world), and here is [my iNaturalist profile](https://www.inaturalist.org/people/1513074).

[iNaturalist](https://www.inaturalist.org/) is dedicated to all types of life, and I've now contributed over ten thousand observations over the past few years. One experience I had with iNaturalist was seeing if I could get over a thousand research-grade observations in New Zealand â€“ at last count, I managed to identify and log over 750 confirmable species while traveling there. I also help maintain some projects, like [Nocturnal Flight Calls](https://www.inaturalist.org/projects/nocturnal-flight-calls). 

[eBird](https://ebird.org/) is specifically for counting and surveying bird populations, where I have also logged tens of thousands of observations. I've enjoyed logging birds in dozens of states and countries over the years, but also I've been largely active in my own state of Vermont. I used eBird to bird in every county in New England in 2020, and [every town in Vermont in 2021](https://val.vtecostudies.org/newsfeed/vermont-town-birding-challenge/). I've used it while participating in the [Vermont eBird County Quest](https://vtecostudies.org/wildlife/wildlife-watching/vermont-county-bird-quest/), the [Forest Bird Monitoring Program](https://vtecostudies.org/projects/forests/vermont-forest-bird-monitoring-program/), [Mountain Birdwatch](https://vtecostudies.org/projects/mountains/mountain-birdwatch/), [Birder Broker](https://val.vtecostudies.org/projects/birder-broker/), [Christmas Bird Counts](https://www.audubon.org/conservation/science/christmas-bird-count), the [National Midwinter Bald Eagle Survey](https://corpslakes.erdc.dren.mil/employees/bird/midwinter.cfm), and many other surveys, as well as generally using it every day for years. I no longer actively paritcipate in some surveys (due to hearing loss), but continue to contribute actively elsewhere.

I also sometimes use other citizen science projects, like [Xeno Canto](https://xeno-canto.org/contributor/PDOWUIYNTF), which is a database of bird audio recordings in Europe, which I mainly use for [Nocturnal Flight Calls](../nocturnal-flight-calls/).

Some of [my academic research](../publications/) has focused on citizen science websites like these. 

The photo of the Common Raven is mine. I take a lot of nature photographs, which I also upload to these websites.
