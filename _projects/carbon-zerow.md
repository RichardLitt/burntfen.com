In the winter of 2016, four of my friends rowed across the Atlantic Ocean, from La Gomera in the Canaries to Antigua in the Caribbean, in a small row boat. They offset all of the cost of the travel, and performed the first carbon neutral row of the ocean. I was their social media contact during their time, talking over a poor Satellite phone connection. And I was there for them when they arrived in Antigua, to help coordinate efforts and to clean the boat. Two of them - Brian Kerr and [Kyle Smith](https://www.energymutual.com/) - I'd known since my first year at Edinburgh in 2006, and this a fantastic milestone in a decade of friendship with them. I couldn't be prouder of their extraordinary work and resolve, and I was honoured to be a member of their expedition.
