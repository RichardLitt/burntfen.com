I am an occasional actor in local theatre in Vermont. I moved to Vermont in the fall of 2018, and the first week here I auditioned for a role in the Plainfield Little Theater in Shakespeare's _Merchant of Venice_. My lease was until the end of January, and the play was in February, so I extended my lease a month. After the performances, I auditioned and got a role in _Macbeth_, and extended my lease a few more months. And then _Cherry Orchard_. And I haven't left the state yet.

I also acted in some small roles in high school, and in university at [Bedlam Theatre](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bedlam_Theatre), including during the [Edinburgh Fringe](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edinburgh_Festival_Fringe), although in both places I did significantly more as part of the tech crew, particularly as an audio engineer, before I realized the extent of my congenital hearing loss.
