For two years while attending Edinburgh University in Scotland, I wrote and published an online webcomic, around three times a week. The comic was quickly drawn and more of an attempt to see if I could write comics consistently, and was very depressing at times.  By the end, it gathered around 100 hits a day.

One of the comics, dividing a park in Edinburgh into sections named after Mario quadrants, goes viral every year, and is still used to reference different locations in the park. The original idea for this is from my good friend _Stephen Kyle_.
