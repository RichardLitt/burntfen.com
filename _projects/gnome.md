I am the Interim Executive Director for the GNOME Foundation. GNOME, originally an acronym for GNU Network Object Model Environment, is a free and open-source desktop environment for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. It is used by millions of users. I took over after the previous ED stepped down, and I am doing my best to help the OSS organization during a difficult transition period.

Being the ED also means I get to go to GUADEC in Denver, which has been exciting so far. That's where I am writing this.
