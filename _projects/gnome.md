I was the Interim Executive Director for the GNOME Foundation, from July 2024 to May 2025. GNOME, originally an acronym for GNU Network Object Model Environment, is a free and open-source desktop environment for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. It is used by millions of users. I took over after the previous ED stepped down, and I did my best to help the OSS organization during a difficult transition period. It was very, very stressful at times. I said goodbye [here](https://blogs.gnome.org/richardlitt/2025/05/02/so-long-and-thanks-for-all-the-fish/).

I am also now a [Foundation Member](https://foundation.gnome.org/membership/), I think for life. So that's nice.
