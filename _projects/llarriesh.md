After I had built the [Na'vi Dictionary](../learn-navi) and was working on [Dothraki](../dothraki), I wanted to try building my own language. The result was Llárriésh, a strange language that is almost impossible to speak. I built it during a couple of months when I was trapped in Princeton, NJ, working at an ice cream shop.
