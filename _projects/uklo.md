While I was still a student at Edinburgh University, I volunteered to help out the United Kingdom Linguistics Olympiad by building them a new site. I was the webmaster for several years, helping out an organisation that teaches high school kids across the UK (and internationally, as part of the Linguistics Olympiad network) about linguistics.

The new site is being developed by a friend of mine, _Simon Vansintjan_, and I have stepped back into more of a mentor role.
