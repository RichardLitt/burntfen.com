I have been a nature photographer for years, but I have only recently started publishing my work as work itself, as opposed to as part of [citizen science sites](../citizen-science/) like iNaturalist or eBird. I have a few galleries available on [this site](https://burntfencreativellc.pixieset.com/), and my work is being displayed in [Kellogg-Hubbard Library](https://www.kellogghubbard.org/) downtown in Montpelier, Vermont this February.
