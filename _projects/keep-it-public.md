Keep It Public is a non-profit committed to keeping public lands in public hands. They have a coalitional approach in which we bring together many user groups to unite under the common goal of protecting public lands from a transfer or sale. I've been helping out here and there for the past few months, advising them on tech issues that come up. This is similar to my [Access Land](../access-land/) work I did in 2014.

If you're interested in keeping our lands from turning into toxic waste dumps, check them out.
