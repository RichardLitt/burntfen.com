Mellow Pages Library was a collaborative library that allowed anyone to donate and take out books and become members for free. It existed for two years in Bushwick, Brooklyn, and was run by _Matt Nelson_ and _Jacob Perkins_. I built and maintained their website for them, and hosted at least one reading at the actual space.

Mellow Pages later closed, and the site is now down, but it continues as a library pop-up at Silent Barn, another venue in Bushwick. [Their new website](http://theatlasreview.com/mellow-pages-library/) is now maintained and hosted as part of Atlas Review.
