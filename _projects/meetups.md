I regularly speak at meetups and conferences about code, open source, and research. The image you see is from the logos of three of the meetups I used to help organize: [BostonJS](http://bostonjs.com/), [BrooklynJS](http://brooklynjs.com/), and [Papers We Love Boston](www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Boston-Cambridge/).
