I regularly speak at meetups about code, mostly about JavaScript. The image you see is from the logos of three of the meetups: [BostonJS](http://bostonjs.com/), [BrooklynJS](http://brooklynjs.com/), and [Papers We Love Boston](www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Boston-Cambridge/), which I coorganized for a few months. I upload all of my slides [here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/talks).
