I regularly speak at meetups about code, mostly about JavaScript. The image you see is from the logos of three of the meetups: [BostonJS](http://bostonjs.com/), [BrooklynJS](http://brooklynjs.com/), and [Papers We Love Boston](www.meetup.com/Papers-We-Love-Boston-Cambridge/), which I coorganize. I upload all of my slides [here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/talks).

  - BrooklynJS, November 19, 2015. Title: `$ git yolo`.
  - ArcticJS, January 20, 2016. Title: `$ git yolo`. [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_KY9ltbdoK4&list=PL3bvPCw5QCLLJUL2Q_bBI1bi9bYQ-4hci&index=3).
  - BostonJS, March 3, 2016. Title: `$ name-your-contributors`

I also have given dozens of academic talks about linguistics: for a list of publications, go [here](/projects/publications/).
