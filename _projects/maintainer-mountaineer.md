I run a company that helps people and organizations maintain their open source projects. As far as I know, it's one of the only examples of a company doing this.

I wrote about launching it, [on Medium](https://medium.com/@richlitt/oss-maintenance-as-a-service-helping-maintainers-maintain-their-code-f9717e4990ad).
