I ran a consultancy that helps people, communities and organizations maintain, build, and grow their open source projects, from around 2017 to 2022. I wrote about launching it, [on Medium](https://medium.com/@richlitt/oss-maintenance-as-a-service-helping-maintainers-maintain-their-code-f9717e4990ad).

I eventually sunset it, as the model wasn't great - community managers as a drop-in service are much less effective than building out that role within the teams you're working in. Instead, I largely used Maintainer Mountaineer as a way of getting those larger contracts. At some point, it outlived its usefulness as a separate service, so I closed it down.

You can see what the website looked like, [here](/assets/img/maintainer website.png).

I, of course, am still interested in helping open source projects. If you have questions, get in touch.
