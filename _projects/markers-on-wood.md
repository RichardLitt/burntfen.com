I've been experimenting with sharpies and cardboard for over a decade. Recently, I've attempted a project with a bit more ambition, moving from paper and pencil to markers on wooden, sanded boards. My style remains the same - comics, in the form of the [Burnt Fen Maunderings](/projects/the-burnt-fen-maunderings).

Interested buyers should send me an email. So should disinterested critics.
