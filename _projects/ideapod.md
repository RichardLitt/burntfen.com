I was the front end developer and first hire for this idea-sharing website. I was able to work with an amazing team on it, and learned Angular and front end development here. In a little over a year, I went from being a computational linguist python scripter to fully owning the Angular front end and design for this site. Every bit of Sass and JavaScript on the site used to be mine, and I'm very proud of the work I did there.
