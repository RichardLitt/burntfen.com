I am a PhD student in the Computer Science department at Te Herenga Waka – Victoria University of Wellington. I moved to Pōneke Wellington in August 2024. My advisor is [Kris Bubendorfer](https://people.wgtn.ac.nz/kris.bubendorfer).

My work is focusing on modelling avian life in Aotearoa New Zealand. I want to focus on bioacoustics; right now, I am working on building an agent-based model of bird populations in Aotearoa New Zealand and predicting the effect of avian bird flu on birds here.

I'd love to talk more about it, but I should probably stop working on this and just get back to it for now. Reach out!
