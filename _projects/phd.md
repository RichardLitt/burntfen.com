I am a PhD student in Computer Science at Te Herenga Waka – Victoria University of Wellington. I moved to Pōneke Wellington, Aotearoa New Zealand in August 2024. My degrees are:

* MA (Hons) from the University of Edinburgh
* MSc Language and Communications Technology (with a specialization in Computational Linguistics) from Saarland University

To contact me, **email**: richard.littauer at ecs.vuw.ac.nz or richard at this website.

I actively publish and work in several different areas:
 * **ornithology**, avian bird flu, and community science
 * taxonomic **nomenclature**
 * using open source to further **open science**
 * **linguistics**

A full list of my work is given below.

## My Thesis

Building Tools for Community Science Datasets to Model Bird Populations and Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in Aotearoa New Zealand

#### Proposal Abstract

Community science platforms have enabled the creation of global observational datasets which afford unprecedented insights into natural biodiversity.
The heterogeneous nature of the data presents significant challenges for standardisation, quality assurance, quality control, and workflow management. The goal of my research is to build tools that enable researchers to use these datasets with higher degrees of certainty, to develop workflows to allow for standardised, reproducible processing of the data, and to use case studies that offer meaning- ful insights into how community science can be used to understand epidemiol- ogy and population demographics, in order to inform public policy. I focus, in particular, on bird populations in Aoteaora New Zealand and Oceania, and on predicting the oncoming significant threat posed by Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI).
