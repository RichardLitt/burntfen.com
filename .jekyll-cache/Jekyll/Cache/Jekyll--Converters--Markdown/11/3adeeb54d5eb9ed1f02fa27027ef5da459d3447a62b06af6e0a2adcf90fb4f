<p>I’ve had two new publications published recently.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Richard Littauer, Sean G. Roberts, James Winters, Rachael Bailes, Michael Pleyer, Hannah Little (2014). <em>From the Savannah to the Cloud: Blogging Evolutionary Linguistics Research</em>. In: L. McCrohon, B. Thompson, T. Verhoef, H. Yamauchi, eds., <em>The Past, Present and Future of Language Evolution Research: Student Volume of the 9th International Conference on the Evolution of Language</em>, pp.121-132. Tokyo, Japan: Evolang 9 Organizing Committee. <a href="https://www.burntfen.com/publications/bib/LittEvoC.bib">bib</a></li>
  <li>Richard Littauer, Boris Villazon-Terrazas, Steven Moran (2013). <a href="http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W13-5508">Linguistic Resources Enhanced with Geospatial Information</a>. In: C. Chiarcos, P. Cimiano, T. Declerck, J. McCrae, eds., <em>Proceedings of the 2nd Workshop on Linked Data in Linguistics (LDL-2013): Representing and linking lexicons, terminologies and other language data</em>, pp. 53-58. Pisa, Italy: Association for Computational Linguistics. <a href="https://www.burntfen.com/publications/bib/LittLDL.bib">bib</a></li>
</ul>

<p>I’m pretty proud of both of them. The first is a description of what we’re doing over at <a href="http://www.replicatedtypo.com">Replicated Typo</a>, and how we hope the field of linguistics and academic research can change. I haven’t posted much there recently, but it’s a good overview of academic blogging in general.</p>

<p>The second is a really cool test study of the power of linked data to map out GIS, and how we can use this in Linguistics.</p>
