<p>Last weekend I had the opportunity to go to the <a href="http://barcampwroclaw.org/">Barcamp in Wroclaw</a>.
A barcamp is an <em>un</em>-conference event, made more for audience
participation than for scheduled talks. This Barcamp was organised by
the <a href="http://www.unexus.org/team">Unexus Team</a>, which means that I had
the chance to hang out out with Justin Brown and Mark Bakacs, the two founders of Unexus, 
and also  with<a href="http://johan.janssens.me/">Johan Johanssens</a>, cofounder of <a href="http://www.joomla.org">Joomla</a>,
as well as the current founder of <a href="http://nooku.org/">Nooku</a>. Justin and
Mark were the ones who enabled me to come; I am now on board as the new
front-end developer for Unexus, which means I will be helping to develop
the user experience for a social network website with a lot of
potential. Iâ€™ll most likely be blogging more about that in the coming
months. I wasnâ€™t able to meet Markâ€™s brother Pete, our designer, but I
am going to be working closely with him.</p>

<p>The Barcamp itself lasted a day; there were around 30 people there, and
there were some pretty interesting talks. Most interesting, for me, was
Johanâ€™s talk about FOSS, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software">Free and Open Source Software</a>.
He started out with the tagline that <em>Open Source is
not like free beer</em> - rather, <em>Itâ€™s free as in Freedom.</em>
Another good talk for me was Kamil Rudnikiâ€™s presentation of <a href="http://www.timecamp.com/">TimeCamp</a>,
a time-tracking productivity software that started in the past few years
and already has a good client base. Iâ€™m going to be working with Kamil
to integrate my own <a href="http://wyrdin.com">Wired/Wyrd In</a> startup with his.
Mine is more focused on task organisation and planning, while his is
much more about screen-tracking, like RescueTime, and time-tracking.
Together, along with tools like <a href="http://www.trello.com">Trello</a>, we
should end up with a pretty solid product. Kamil gave me a ton of good
links to follow up, namely:</p>

<ul>
  <li>www.timecamp.com/auth/register</li>
  <li>www.visikid.com</li>
  <li>www.timeandtracking.com</li>
  <li>www.jerela.com</li>
  <li><a href="http://todotxt.com/">Todo.txt</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://letsfreckle.com/">LetsFreckle</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Johan also gave some good discussion of licensing models, something Iâ€™ve
been struggling with researching recently. Importantly, it seems that the
license of a software only becomes applicable when you distribute
the software. That only happens when the software goes from a copyright
holder to a non-copyright holder. In essence, Github is distribution. I
am going to have to move Wyrd In off of Github, soon, then - Iâ€™ll
probably set up a git repo on my own server to deal with it.</p>

<p>And that was the weekend, in a nutshell. When I got back, I had a ton of
fresh ideas, a good perspective on what I am doing with Unexus, and a
cold. Thatâ€™s alright though; it was worth it.</p>
