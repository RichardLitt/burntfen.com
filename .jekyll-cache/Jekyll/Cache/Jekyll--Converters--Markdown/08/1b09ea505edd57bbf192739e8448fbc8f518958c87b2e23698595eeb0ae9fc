<p>A new book review of mine was published the other week, in Linguist List. Here are the details:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Richard Littauer (2013). <em>Review of F. Seifart, G. Haig, N. Himmelmann, D. Jung, A. Margetts, &amp; P. Trilsbeek, eds., Potentials of Language Documentation: Methods, Analyses, and Utilization. In: Language Documentation &amp; Conservation Special Publication No. 3. Online: University of Hawaiâ€™i Press.</em> In: <em>LINGUIST List</em>, 24.2604. <a href="http://linguistlist.org/pubs/reviews/get-review.cfm?SubID=12670360">URL</a></li>
</ul>

<p>It was a fun book to read, and it is also free. I suggest browsing through the LDCJ if you are interested in low resource languages.</p>
