<p>I ran across this email from Reuters in my inbox today. <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/05/24/us-usa-campaign-idUSBRE84H13020120524?feedType=RSS&amp;feedName=domesticNews">Romney opens new front vs Obama: schools are failing</a></p>

<p>What shall I think of this? My first thought was <em>Good, Iâ€™m glad that is
being talked about.</em> This was followed almost immediately by <em>Romney
must be an OK guy to bring this up, as it is important. Maybe I should
reconsider calling him an asshole before I actually look at his issues,
just based on his party and what I remember of his assinine comments in
the primaries.</em></p>

<p>Of course, I then realised that this, too, is wrong. There are two
biases playing out here: one being a cognitive bias, and the other being
the bias of the news team. To understand, consider these questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>How do we know that Romney actually cares?</li>
  <li>Are failing schools in any way connected to Romney?</li>
  <li>Has Obama not being doing enough for schools?</li>
  <li>If he has been doing stuff, then why is this a new front?</li>
  <li>Why is Romney seemingly on the offensive here? Even the language
suggests it.</li>
  <li>How, on earth, is this a <em>new</em> front? Surely schools have been
failing America for decades?</li>
</ul>

<p>Basic point: Be very careful what you think after reading a headline.
Youâ€™re probably wrong, at first.</p>
