<p>I serve on the <a href="https://github.com/nodejs/i18n">Node.js i18n Working Group</a>, and have also served on the <a href="http://github.com/nodejs/community-committee">Node.js Community Committee</a> as a member in 2017. Iâ€™ve been part of the Node community for many years, and this is part of how I give back to the awesome people and project who have helped me out as a JavaScript developer over the years.</p>
