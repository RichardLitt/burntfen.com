<p>I wrote a blog about what it means to be a nomad; what the downsides are, and how the lifestyle changes you. I have lived and worked largely on the road for the past decade. Most of it is founded on my own experiences, living as a digital nomad.</p>

<p>This blog was a collaborative effort with my old friend from high school, <a href="https://www.jakinney.com/">Jen Kinney.</a> Sheâ€™s done excellent work, mostly as a photographer.</p>

<p>We decided to shutter it after priorities changed, in early 2018.</p>
