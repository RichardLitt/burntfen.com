<p>Today, I added all of the codes that were given to me in the Simulating
Language course at the University of Edinburgh to my <a href="https://github.com/RichardLitt/CoLitt/tree/master/Simulating%20Language">CoLitt
Github</a>.
I took this course between January and March 2010, and it is still being
offered at Edinburgh - I talked for 45 minutes last night with a friend
of mine who is taking it. There are some modifications to the course -
more with neural networks, some stuff about priors that I don’t
remember, but it is essentially the same. In essence, the teachers hand
out lots of code, tell you to fiddle around with it, and that’s how you
learn.</p>

<p>I’m not sure I approve of this technique, which is one of the reasons I
loaded the code up. The main reason, of course, is that I am for opening
up notes wherever possible (I loaded my notes in, too). I think that the
more access you have, the more likely you’ll use that access, the more
you’ll learn. Back to the technique - this teaches you how to manipulate
code, but it doesn’t teach you how to code per se. Today I was asked a
question that a CS child could answer (I’d rather not embarass myself by
admitting what it was.) But because of the fact that I learned
haphazardly, I couldn’t answer. Had I taken a CS course at any point, I
would have been able to. I’ve still got a long way to go.</p>

<p>I’m not saying I disliked the course - I loved it, I recieved my highest
mark in it, I’m publishing my essay from it in a journal (admittedly, a
journal for undergrads), and because of that course I went on to do my
dissertation in that field, which lead me to go to Kyoto and to Germany.
But, I wish I had had access to the code more, that I had been taught
how to program and not how to ‘break something then fix it’. In any
event, I hope this is useful to someone out there.</p>
