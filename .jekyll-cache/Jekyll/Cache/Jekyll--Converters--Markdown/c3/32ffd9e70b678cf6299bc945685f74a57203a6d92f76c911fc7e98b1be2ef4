<p>As part of my job at <a href="../hipcamp">Hipcamp</a>, I built a petition website for a coalition of 50+ organizations, including REI, The Sierra Club, and Code for America, committed to increasing access to public land through open data. The code was based on a petition site from <a href="https://twitter.com/FreedomofPress">Freedom of the Press</a>, and the design was touched up by the amazing designer <a href="http://julianbialowas.com/">Julian Bialowas</a>.</p>
