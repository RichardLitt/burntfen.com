<p>I decided that<br />
now was the<br />
time<br />
to write<br />
that<br />
poem.</p>

<p>But<br />
the tea <br />
needed<br />
to be brewed.<br />
my bladder<br />
wouldn’t empty itself.<br />
the sunset<br />
was drooping.</p>

<p>And it was<br />
then<br />
that I found<br />
my little poem,<br />
about the way<br />
the hills looked,<br />
like Japan,<br />
detailed,<br />
and full of<br />
their own<br />
molded earth,</p>

<p>my<br />
little<br />
poem,</p>

<p>was…</p>

<p>of what was I<br />
thinking <br />
again?</p>

<p>and why is my<br />
tea<br />
cold?</p>
