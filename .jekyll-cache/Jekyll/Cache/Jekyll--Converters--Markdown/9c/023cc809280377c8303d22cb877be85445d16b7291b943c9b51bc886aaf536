<p>I attended <a href="http://arcticjs.club">ArcticJS</a>, the first JavaScript conference above the Arctic circle. Started as a pseudo-joke by some hackers travelling around Europe (in particular, <a href="//twitter.com/feross">@feross</a>, <a href="//twitter.com/mafintosh">@mafintosh</a>,  and <a href="//twitter.com/wa7son">@wa7son</a>), this swiftly spiralled out of control, and 13 participants came to Svalbard to talk about JS and enjoy the long night.</p>

<p>I gave a talk about <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">$ git yolo</code>, just as I did at BrooklynJS in November. I also helped organize the conference, helping with logistics and so on. It was mad fun. (I am currently writing this from the northernmost church in the world, where I am watching a talk, actually.)</p>
