<p>I monitor migrating birds nocturnal flight calls every spring and fall. This involves some fun recording equipment, some machine learning algorithms, open source work, and community building with other NFC (US) and NocMig (UK) enthusiasts.</p>

<p>I’ve cofounded <a href="https://list.uvm.edu/cgi-bin/wa?A0=NFC">an NFC listserv</a> in Vermont with middling to low traffic. I generally upload calls to <a href="https://ebird.org/profile/Mjg0MTUx/GB-SCT">eBird</a>, <a href="https://www.inaturalist.org/people/1513074">iNaturalist</a>, and <a href="https://xeno-canto.org/contributor/PDOWUIYNTF">XenoCanto</a>.</p>

<p>For a talk on what this means:</p>

<p>If you’re curious, the call image shown is a <a href="https://ebird.org/checklist/S73724113">Dickcissel</a>, which I heard live on my birthday a few years ago. Why I was awake at 2:00am in the morning is a question I often wonder when doing NFC research.</p>
