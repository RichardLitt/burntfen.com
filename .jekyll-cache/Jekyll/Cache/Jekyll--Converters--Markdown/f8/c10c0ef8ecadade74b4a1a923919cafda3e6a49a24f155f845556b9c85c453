  <li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Man_Who_Was_Thursday">The Man Who Was Thursday</a> by G.K. Chesterton.
    <ul>
      <li>This book gets better, each time I read it. I have a long history with this book, starting when I was around ten. It took me ten years to read it fully, and I regretted the lost time immensely. The ending is fantastic, and Iâ€™ve never looked at trees the same way since.</li>
