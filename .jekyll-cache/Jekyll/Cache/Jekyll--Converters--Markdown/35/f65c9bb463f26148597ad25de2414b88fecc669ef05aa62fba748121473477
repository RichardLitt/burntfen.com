<p>There is no centralised list of open-source code that would be useful for documenting, conserving, developing, preserving, or working with endangered languages. According to some estimates, half of the 7,000~ currently spoken languages are expected to become extinct this century (Wikipedia). However, there is a lot of work by academics, independent scholars, organizations, communities, and individuals which goes towards stopping or slowing this trend. I created a list to document what is out there for the developer community on GitHub (and hopefully, beyond), and work with amazing linguists and developers keeping it up to date and relevant. At the moment, it is the only list dedicated towards open source code for minority languages that I know of.</p>

<p>This is also an “awesome” list, like <a href="../awesome">others</a> I maintain, according to the <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome">awesome list standards</a>.</p>
