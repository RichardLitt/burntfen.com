<p>I’ve seen this quote on the web a few places, but it often has errors. I went back to the book and fixed them, and added the paragraph on money and sex that is often not included.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To be truly challenging, a voyage, like a life, must rest on a firm foundation of financial unrest. Otherwise you are doomed to a routine traverse, the kind known to yachtsmen, who play with their boats at sea - “cruising,” it is called. Voyaging belongs to seamen, and to the wanderers of the world who cannot, or will not, fit in. If you are contemplating a voyage and you have the means, abandon the venture until your fortunes change. Only then will you know what the sea is all about.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Little has been said or written about the ways a man may blast himself free. Why? I don’t know, unless the answer lies in our diseased values. A man seldom hesitates to describe his work; he gladly divulges the privacies of alleged sexual conquests. But ask him how much he has in the bank and he recoils into a shocked and stubborn silence.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I’ve always wanted to sail to the south seas, but I can’t afford it.” What these men can’t afford is <em>not</em> to go. They are enmeshed in the cancerous discipline of “security.” And in the worship of security we fling our lives beneath the wheels of routine - and before we know it our lives are gone.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>What does a man need - really need? A few pounds of food each day, heat and shelter, six feet to lie down in - and some form of working activity that will yield a sense of accomplishment. That’s all - in the material sense. And we know it. But we are brainwashed by our economic system until we end up in a tomb beneath a pyramid of time payments, mortgages, preposterous gadgetry, playthings that divert our attention from the sheer idiocy of the charade.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The years thunder by, The dreams of youth grow dim where they lie caked in dust on the shelves of patience. Before we know it, the tomb is sealed.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Where, then, lies the answer? In choice. Which shall it be: bankruptcy of purse or bankruptcy of life?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>– Sterling Hayden, <em>Wanderer</em></p>

<p>This quote is often on my background, and it is one of the main reasons I embarked recently on a major attempt to save myself from leaping out of windows. More on that later. Obviously, I think you should all read his book, <em>Wanderer</em>.</p>
