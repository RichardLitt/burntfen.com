<p>I led a team of six in the Erasmus Mundi Alumni Associationâ€™s incubator, <a href="http://www.em-a.eu/en/ema-activities/realise-it.html">Realise It</a>, building a time keeper and task organiser. The prototype was based on a tool I had built while a student at Saarland University, in Germany, on an Erasmus Mundus scholarship, working towards my MSc in Computational Linguistics.</p>
