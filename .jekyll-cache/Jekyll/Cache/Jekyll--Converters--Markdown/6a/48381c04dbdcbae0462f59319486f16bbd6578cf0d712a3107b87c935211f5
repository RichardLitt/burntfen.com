<p>I review every book I read on this site, <a href="../../the-litt-review">The Litt Review</a>. I want to get better at thinking about books instead of just passively reading them, and writing a review is a good way to do that. I also write private notes with all of the quotes I underline and all of my marginalia, as well as all vocabulary I didnâ€™t recognize, but I generally donâ€™t share those publicly.</p>

<p>Previous to 2017, I would just write down each book in a list. You can read those, here.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="/books/2017">2017</a></li>
  <li><a href="/2017-02-08/books-i-read-in-2016">2016</a></li>
  <li><a href="/2015-12-29/books-i-read-in-2015">2015</a></li>
  <li><a href="/2015-01-04/books-from-2014">2014</a></li>
</ul>
