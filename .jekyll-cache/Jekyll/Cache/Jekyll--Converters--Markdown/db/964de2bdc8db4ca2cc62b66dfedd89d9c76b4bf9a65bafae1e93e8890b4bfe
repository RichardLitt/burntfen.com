<p>The User Is Drunk is a UX/UI consultancy website, with a twist: I review sites while under the influence of alcohol. The site went viral: it hit the top of Hacker News, gathered 100k hits in the first week, and generated over 50+ clients, including some major companies like Hubspot, Gizmodo, and VWO.</p>

<p>I wrote a retrospective on Medium that got over 100 recommends: <a href="https://medium.com/@richlitt/the-user-has-sobered-up-df0b411997ea#.zbdpg4f1t">The User Has Sobered Up</a>, and <a href="https://www.shopify.com/partners/blog/78184134-10-things-i-learned-about-ux-by-being-drunk">this post</a> on Shopifyâ€™s blog about some tips concerning UX.</p>
