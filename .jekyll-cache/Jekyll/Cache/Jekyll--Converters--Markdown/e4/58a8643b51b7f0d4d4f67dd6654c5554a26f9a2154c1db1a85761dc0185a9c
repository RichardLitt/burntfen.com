<p>After my work on <a href="../learn-navi">LearnNavi.org</a>, I was pretty excited to hear that <em><a href="http://dedalvs.com/">David Peterson</a></em> had been contracted through the <a href="http://conlang.org/">Language Creation Society</a> (I used to be on <a href="http://conlang.org/about-the-lcs/officers-directors/">the board</a>) to build Dothraki and other Languages for HBOâ€™s <em>Game of Thrones</em>. So, with some help from other people at LearnNavi, I set up <a href="http://www.dothraki.org/">Dothraki.org</a> to be a fan community for the language. Most of my immediate work went into building the <a href="http://www.dothraki.org/">wiki</a>. However, I soon moved on to focus on my Masterâ€™s program, and have not been active in the community for some time.</p>
