<p>I ran this twitter account to build hype for Valyrian, a language from GRR Martin’s <em>Game of Thrones</em>. A few months after creating it, it was announced that David Peterson would create it for the HBO series, and I subsequently closed the account.</p>

<p>I also have the novelty Twitter account <a href="https://twitter.com/AynRandAlThor">@AynRandAlThor</a>, for people who liked Robert Jordan’s <em>The Wheel of Time</em> and also like Ayn Rand (or don’t).</p>

<p>This is somewhat related to my <a href="../dothraki">Dothraki</a> and <a href="../learn-navi">Na’vi</a> work.</p>
