<p>Keep It Public is a non-profit committed to keeping public lands in public hands. They have a coalition approach in which we bring together many user groups to unite under the common goal of protecting public lands from a transfer or sale. I’ve been helping out here and there for the past few months, advising them on tech issues that come up. This is similar to my <a href="../access-land/">Access Land</a> work I did in 2014.</p>
