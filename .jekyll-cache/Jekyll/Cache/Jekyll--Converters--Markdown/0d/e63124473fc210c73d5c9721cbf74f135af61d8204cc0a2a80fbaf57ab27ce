<p>In January, I was asked to describe the plot of a film. Instead, I used a transparent text editor, and wrote my thoughts about the film while I watched it on the same computer. Iâ€™ve done the same for every film Iâ€™ve watched alone, excepting 1, Men in Black, since. Since I didnâ€™t want to release the scripts too early, as Iâ€™m trying to stick with projects longer, I waited until an arbitrary number were done - 27.</p>

<p>Think of it like Mystery Science Theatre, but without having the movie at the same time, and literally whatever comes into my head. The most commented was The Notebook. The Hunter was my favourite. The title came from a thought I had in the middle of Footloose. Check out the <a href="http://laserspews.tumblr.com/archive">archive</a> for more.</p>

<p>Please feel free to share this, to suggest films, and to call me out for any weird comments. This is an experiment.</p>
