<p>I picked up this graphic novel as part of <a href="https://www.drawnandquarterly.com/">Drawn and Quarterly</a>â€™s monthly Graphic Novel bookclub. Drawn and Quarterly is a bookshop here in MontrÃ©al, in Mile End, which specializes in graphic novels. It has the best selection of any shop I have seen. Iâ€™m still waiting for the right reason to buy <em>Blankets</em>, my favorite graphic novel, and every time I go there I am sorely tempted. I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s held me back so far.</p>

<p>I hadnâ€™t attended the bookclub yet, but, hoping for the best, I forked over a bit and bought this one without looking at a review. I am not entirely glad I did. I enjoy reading graphic novels, but theyâ€™re not exactly novel to me. Iâ€™ve read <em>V for Vendetta</em>, <em>Watchmen</em>, <em>Identity Crisis</em>, all of <em>Sandman</em>. When I was a teenager, I read manga after manga, soaking them up. So I wasnâ€™t buying this book for the novelty - I was hoping it would genuinely be good.</p>

<p>Had I done a bit more research, I would have learned that this is a prequel novel, which is meant to shore up some of the backstory for an ongoing series called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Unwritten"><em>The Unwritten</em></a>. The book is split into two parts, which are intertwined. The first is about a man impossible to sympathize with, who decides to raise his son and write a novel about his life, at the expense of his wife, the sonâ€™s privacy, and his own conscience; the second follows a non-magical orphan raised as a kitchen-helper in a magic school, who gradually learns what happened to his parents and why he isnâ€™t magical himself. Thereâ€™s vampires and speeches, fights and Dumbledores, even a ginger sidekick and a daemon of sorts.</p>

<p>Frankly: it read as forced, the plots didnâ€™t resolve, Iâ€™m not sure that the book is better for the real-life father-son story, and itâ€™s completely confusing why theyâ€™re mixed together in the first place. I see it touted as â€˜stand aloneâ€™ on the net - but I think this is from the perspective of people who have already read <em>The Unwritten</em>, or who at least know it exists. I hadnâ€™t, and didnâ€™t, and it wasnâ€™t until after I forced myself through the book and googled what the hell it was talking about that I figured out I hadnâ€™t accidentally stumbled on a long, absurdist art piece.</p>

<p>I havenâ€™t started <em>The Unwritten</em> yet. If I had, I might be able to tell you this makes sense after. I may in the future. For now - donâ€™t read this book if you havenâ€™t read the rest.</p>

<p>So, that aside, was there anything OK in it? Sure. Some of the art was pretty cool. The styles changed clearly later in the book, which I found unnerving and unnecessary (I felt it was something like a plot device, shadowing unreality, which was interesting but only added to my confusion about what the book was doing). Thereâ€™s at least one good scene, involving the reason the series is called â€˜the unwrittenâ€™, too.</p>

<p>Overall, though, Iâ€™m disappointed. When the bookclub date came, I went to a launch party for <a href="http://www.unevenearth.org/2017/08/uneven-earth-summer-party/">Uneven Earth</a>, and found myself watching the documentary <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jul/24/accidental-anarchist-life-without-government-review-paradise-war-torn-syria"><em>Accidental Anarchist</em></a> instead. I donâ€™t regret that, at all.</p>

<p>(But I bought <a href="https://www.drawnandquarterly.com/uncomfortably-happily">the next book</a> in the bookclub anyway).</p>
