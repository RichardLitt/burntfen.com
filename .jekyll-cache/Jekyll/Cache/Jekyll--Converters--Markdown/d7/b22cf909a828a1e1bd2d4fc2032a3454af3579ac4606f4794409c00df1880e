<p>Collaborators: <em>Scotty Allen, Pam Allen</em></p>

<p>The User Is My Mom is a follow-up product to <a href="../the-user-is-drunk">The User is Drunk</a>, where my friend <em>Scotty Allen</em>â€™s mom, <em>Pam Allen</em>, reviewed sites while we guided her through them. The idea was that an older person, who hadnâ€™t grown up with the internet, would have different opinions about good UX than most current designers or focus groups.</p>

<p>While not as successful as The User Is Drunk, it did fairly well, and got a good deal of press and some dozen or so clients, before we closed off the pay-whenever-you-want service and moved it to a contract consultancy service. It has 50k~ page views, and also hit the top of Hacker News.</p>
