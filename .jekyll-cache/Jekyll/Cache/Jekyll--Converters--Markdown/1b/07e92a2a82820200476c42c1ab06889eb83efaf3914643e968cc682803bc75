<p>The majority of my coding these days appears to be based around birds. Much of what Iâ€™ve been working on has been fun little side projects for <a href="https://birdinginvermont.com">birdinginvermont.com</a>, my little site for playing around with eBird data and for finding new ways to gamify or help understand birding and birds.</p>

<p>One tool that Iâ€™ve built recently is a VBRC checker: <a href="https://birdinginvermont.com/vbrc-checker">https://birdinginvermont.com/vbrc-checker</a>.</p>

<p>The VBRC - Vermont Bird Records Committee - is a committee of experts in Vermont who spend time keeping records of what birds are seen in Vermont. They do this not only for birders keen on knowing whatâ€™s around, but also to track long-term changes to bird populations in the state, and to understand when birds breed, migrate, and irrupt here. This spreadsheet can tell you when you should report a bird to the VBRC - but it is also hard to figure out. You have to spend some time looking at the dates, and maybe know more about birding that the average person would. Thatâ€™s OK! Itâ€™s a specialized use-case. In practice, birders who see birds that are rare tell someone who knows how to check for them - someone like a VBRC member, or an eBird reviewer (who are often basically the same thing).</p>

<p>My tool uses the VBRC rare birds spreadsheet to automatically tell you whether a bird in any given town should or should not be submitted to the VBRC checklist. This way, anyone who knows the species for a bird sighting should be able to easily know whether or not they need to let someone at the VBRC know about it. I like that.</p>

<p>Technically, making it was a bit difficult. I used React for the site, and thatâ€™s been a pain to get working at times, especially when mixed with D3 for mapping. I would like to take a lot of the computation and put it in the cloud to speed up the site, but Iâ€™m not sure how to do that without making a headless browser for D3.js and generally just making the whole thing a horrible monolith. So, instead, Iâ€™ve just tacked on another page to the site. Let the browser beware the cost of downloading the site on low-data phones, I guess. Besides that, making it was straightforward, and took a few hours - load in data using a drop-down, make these autocomplete to make it easier to avoid spelling issues, and then just use a JSON file which was converted from the old, rather dirty .xls file. Fun work.</p>

<p>Hopefully this site will be useful. Let me know if you hear of anyone using it!</p>
