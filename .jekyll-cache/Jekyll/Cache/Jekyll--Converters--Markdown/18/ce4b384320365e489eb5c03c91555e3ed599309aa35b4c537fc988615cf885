<p>Iâ€™ve got a book somewhere in the world that has a chapter with my name as one of the authors. This is a new experience for me. It was fun to work on, mainly because I got to interact with the Open Linguistics people in the OKF. Most of the content of the book chapter is a bit over my head, which is why Iâ€™m last author - I basically helped where I could. Still, pretty nifty.</p>

<p>Hereâ€™s the book announcement I recieved in my inbox yesterday.</p>

<p>Collaboratively Constructed Language Resources (CCLRs) such as Wikipedia, Wiktionary, Linked Open Data, and various resources developed using crowdsourcing techniques such as Games with a Purpose and Mechanical Turk have substantially contributed to the research in natural language processing (NLP). Various NLP tasks utilize such resources to substitute for or supplement conventional lexical semantic resources and linguistically annotated corpora. These resources also provide an extensive body of texts from which valuable knowledge is mined. There are an increasing number of community efforts to link and maintain multiple linguistic resources.</p>

<p>This book offers comprehensive coverage of CCLR-related topics, including their construction, utilization in NLP tasks, and interlinkage and management. Various Bachelor/Master/Ph.D. programs in natural language processing, computational linguistics, and knowledge discovery can use this book both as either main textbook or supplementary reading. The book also provides a valuable reference guide for researchers and professionals for the above topics.</p>
