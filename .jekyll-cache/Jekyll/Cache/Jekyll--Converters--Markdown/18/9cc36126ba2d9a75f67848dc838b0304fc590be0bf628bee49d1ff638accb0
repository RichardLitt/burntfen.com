<p>I ran a consultancy that helps people, communities and organizations maintain, build, and grow their open source projects, from around 2017 to 2022. I wrote about launching it, <a href="https://medium.com/@richlitt/oss-maintenance-as-a-service-helping-maintainers-maintain-their-code-f9717e4990ad">on Medium</a>.</p>

<p>I eventually sunset it, as the model wasnâ€™t great - community managers as a drop-in service are much less effective than building out that role within the teams youâ€™re working in. Instead, I largely used Maintainer Mountaineer as a way of getting those larger contracts. At some point, it outlived its usefulness as a separate service, so I closed it down.</p>

<p>You can see what the website looked like, <a href="/assets/img/maintainer website.png">here</a>.</p>

<p>I, of course, am still interested in helping open source projects. If you have questions, get in touch.</p>
