<p>Thereâ€™s a Calvin and Hobbes strip that shows Calvin getting super excited after seeing the first robin of spring, and demanding appreciation. I wanted people to be able to feel proud of seeing the first robin (even if it does hang out all year round in northern states). So I made a site for it.</p>
