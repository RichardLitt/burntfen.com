<p>Some notes from:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Beyer and Beck (2011). <em>A Linguistic Assessment of the
Munji Language in Afghanistan.</em> Language Documentation &amp; Conservation,
6; pp. 38-103. http://nflrc.hawaii.edu/ldc/</li>
</ul>

<p>This was a generally fascinating paper, and very fun to read alongside
with ‚ÄòA Walk in the Hindu Kush‚Äô, about travels in the area fifty years
before. Here are some sections I highlighted in my reading:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2.3 LINGUISTIC SITUATION. The national languages of Afghanistan are
Dari and Pashto. Both are Indo-European languages, Dari belonging to
the West Iranian group of languages and Pashto to the East Iranian
group. The Ethnologue (Gordon 2005) lists 46 languages for
Afghanistan. Many of these are also spoken in neighboring countries,
as borders were drawn without taking into account the locations and
boundaries of ethnolinguistic groups. Accoding to the new
Constitution of Afghanisatan (in place since 2005), Article 16, the
government supports the development and strengthening of minority
languages. Even the status of a third national language is ascribed to
some languages, in places where the majority speaks them. For example,
Pamiri is mentioned as one of them. <strong>Little research has been conducted
on the minority languages of Afghanistan, and hardly any information
about them is available.</strong></p>
</blockquote>

<p>The splitting up of Afghanistan is a fascinating topic, particularly the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Durand_Line">Durand Line</a>. The great game was a ridiculous affair, where European interests basically ignored the locals and carved up the region. This can still be seen today. In the most sobering part of the paper, Medical Situation, there is this quote:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As we were walking through the villages, people often asked us for
medicine and said, ‚ÄúPlease send us a doctor and an eye doctor. We
don‚Äôt have a doctor in the valley, and the people just die.‚Äù</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I suggest reading the paper - it is a very good assessment of the
language, and predicts that Munji is not in danger of going extinct
soon, thanks to lots of youth learning the language and the people being
proud of it. Let‚Äôs hope this continues.</p>
