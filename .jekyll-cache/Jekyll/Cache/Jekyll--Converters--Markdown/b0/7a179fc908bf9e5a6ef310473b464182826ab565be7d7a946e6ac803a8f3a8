<p>By the monicre â€˜Taronyuâ€™, I created the definitive Naâ€™vi dictionary for the fan community. Naâ€™vi is the language invented by Paul Frommer for the movie Avatar. I became interested it soon after the movie came out, and landed at <a href="http://learnnavi.org">LearnNavi.org</a>, a community of around  5000 regular users at the time. There wasnâ€™t a good dictionary at the time, so I built one. It has since expanded to over 60 pages, and been translated into over a dozen languages, including Naâ€™vi (for a Naâ€™vi-only dictionary April Foolâ€™s Joke by me and a few friends). I still technically function as the administrator of the largest Naâ€™vi site in the world, although I stepped away from maintaining the dictionary a couple of years after starting it.</p>

<p>And no, those Google images from the Sun are never going away.</p>
