<p>While I was still a student at Edinburgh University, I volunteered to help out the United Kingdom Linguistics Olympiad by building them a new site. I was the webmaster for several years, helping out an organisation that teaches high school kids across the UK (and internationally, as part of the Linguistics Olympiad network) about linguistics.</p>

<p>The new site is being developed by a friend of mine, <em>Simon Vansintjan</em>, and I have stepped back into more of a mentor role.</p>
