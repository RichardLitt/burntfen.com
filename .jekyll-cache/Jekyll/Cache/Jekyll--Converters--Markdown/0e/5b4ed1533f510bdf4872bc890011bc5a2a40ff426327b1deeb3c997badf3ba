I"–
<p>Iâ€™ve been working hard at some other projects the past two days (one of
which is re-reading all of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wheel_of_Time">the Wheel of
Time</a> before <em>A Memory
of Light</em>, the last book, comes out), but I have also managed to fill in
a few more pages.</p>

<p>One is the <a href="/projects.html">Projects</a> page, where I give a brief list of
projects I am currently involved with elsewhere on the web - most
notably, <a href="http://unexus.org">Unexus</a>, <a href="http://wyrdin.com">Wyrd In</a>, and
<a href="http://ideaotter.com">IdeaOtter</a>. Iâ€™ve also filled out the <a href="/language-resource-dev.html">Language
Development</a> Projects page, where I talk
about <a href="http://de.clarin.eu">CLARIN</a>, and
<a href="https://github.com/RichardLitt/lrl/tree/master/Maltese">Kelmu</a> and my
Learn Naâ€™vi projects, like <a href="https://github.com/RichardLitt/keypuk-ninavi">translating
Facebook</a> into a language
only a couple of dozen people can actually speak semi-fluently.</p>

<p>If youâ€™re interested in collaboration, because you want to go to Sofia,
too, let me know. Iâ€™m just a click or two away.</p>
