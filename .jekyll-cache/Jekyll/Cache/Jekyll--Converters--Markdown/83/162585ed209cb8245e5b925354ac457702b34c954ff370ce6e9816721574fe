<p>My friend <a href="http://piranhabay.co.uk/">Simon</a>, the coder and designer
who is the main guy behind <a href="http://ideaotter.com/">IdeaOtter</a>, a project
we’ve been working on together, has had another pretty awesome idea:
<a href="http://www.appril.org">Appril</a>.
Again, I helped out a tiny bit, but Simon works far too fast for me, so
the credit goes entirely to him. I’m looking forward to helping out in the coming
months prepare the site and the event. What am I talking about? Here’s
the blurb from his website.</p>

<p>About a week before Github launched their build-a-game competition, I was talking to a couple of friends about an idea I had. Github’s competition got our asses into gear.</p>

<p>We’ve all attended hackathons, and while I like what they represent - what they achieve is often not much more than a concept roughly initiated. Really, to do something right you need more time. How much more time? That varies on what you’re doing. But I’m willing to bet that for most things it’s somewhere around a month. That’s enough to plan out your idea (find one if you haven’t already), get a team of people that you like together (if you want), learn your tools (if you want to learn new tools), and build that thing.</p>

<p>So we want to initiate the first ever <a href="http://www.appril.org">Appril</a>. Come April, we’re going to get together in teams, and push ourselves to build the apps we’ve been meaning to build. Alongside whatever else we’re planning on doing that month.</p>

<p>I know April is 5 months away, but man, wouldn’t it be great if a heck of a lot of people knew about this and participated. It’d be a 30 day hackathon taking place all over the world, and at the end of it, there’d be completed, fully functional, well thought out, applications.  And all the developers would be well rested at the end of it. That would be neat.</p>

<p>Obviously, we’d love any help spreading the word.</p>
