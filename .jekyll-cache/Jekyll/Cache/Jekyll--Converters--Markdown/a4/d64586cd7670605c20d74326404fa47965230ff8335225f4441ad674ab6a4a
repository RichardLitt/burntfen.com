I"∑
<p>My family <br />
has a bad <br />
habit of <br />
killing <br />
ourselves.</p>

<p>My mother<br />
Slammed a smile onto her face<br />
For so many years that it locked itself<br />
I heard her say, once<br />
‚ÄúI need to laugh that way<br />
at least once a year.‚Äù<br />
She moved home, south<br />
where it‚Äôs warm beneath the pine trees</p>

<p>My sister<br />
broke down when she was cut off<br />
At a stop sign in a parking lot<br />
She tried so hard to shelve her childhood<br />
That she forgot it was still there<br />
dusting up and rusting away<br />
She has a child now<br />
And may dust those shelves in time</p>

<p>My brother<br />
Drove the principal‚Äôs car into a lake<br />
And got sent to juvenile<br />
For two long years<br />
He came back five inches taller<br />
With some white stubble<br />
And free entrance to the low security<br />
mental institution in the local hospital</p>

<p>My father<br />
Drank and drank and drank<br />
All of the stars into his bones<br />
until they filled his marrow <br />
until he could walk on his reflection<br />
in the night ocean<br />
feet-bottoms touching</p>

<p>And me<br />
I‚Äôve written these stories<br />
Until the horizon squalls over<br />
And I remember<br />
And my father can‚Äôt walk on water<br />
And my mother loved her dogs<br />
And my sister<br />
is bringing something useful into the world<br />
And I never had a brother<br />
But it sure kills me to pretend.</p>
