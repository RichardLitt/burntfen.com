<p><em>ZoÃ«â€™s Tale</em> was written from the perspective of ZoÃ« Boutin-Perry, a small girl in <em>The Ghost Brigades</em> and a teenager of some import in <em>The Last Colony</em>. Itâ€™s a different perspective book, modelled after <em>Enderâ€™s Shadow</em> and <em>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead</em>. While I love the latter of these two examples, I never really got into <em>Enderâ€™s Shadow</em> very much. I found it to be derivative, lacking in coherent internal narrative, and generally a bit, well, boring. I felt the same about <em>ZoÃ«â€™s Tale</em>. Luckily, Scalzi managed to perform his normal task - humans being snarky, aliens being fun to read about - particularly well, so I didnâ€™t really mind. This was a fun read, although I was not as interested in it as the other books in the series.</p>

<p>I was glad he wrapped up both the Werewolves subplot (which I questioned in my previous review of <em>The Last Colony</em>), and also the <em>deux ex machina</em> of ZoÃ« getting a Consu weapon inexplicably. Iâ€™m not opposed to d.e.m.â€™s in science fiction; after all, thatâ€™s kind of what spaceships are all about. But that hole needed to be filled. Iâ€™m not convinced it couldnâ€™t have been filled in a novella, though. 400 pages was a bit long.</p>

<p>Highlights include teenagers being teenagers (I learned the word â€˜menarcheâ€™ in this book), ZoÃ« meeting the werewolves and managing to close a subplot, and an obscure shoutout to â€œThe Stars My Destinationâ€, which was pretty nice. Overall, a fun, quick read. I didnâ€™t really stop reading it once I started, which is nothing if not a compliment to the writing. Looking forward to the next two books.</p>
