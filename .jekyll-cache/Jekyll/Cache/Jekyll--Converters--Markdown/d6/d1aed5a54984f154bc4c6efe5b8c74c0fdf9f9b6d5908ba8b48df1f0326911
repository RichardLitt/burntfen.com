<blockquote>
  <p>In 2012<br />
My father put on weight.<br />
“I’m 210!” He said,<br />
sniffing like a seal,<br />
mouth set in a clam outline.<br />
He was always skinny,<br />
A crazed, starved prophet.<br />
(Arent’t all prophets false?)<br />
But now, an incipient week away,<br />
He ate and swallowed and grew,<br />
Until even his pants drew tight.<br />
An old tree,<br />
Growing through a white fence.<br />
Eating and growing<br />
“Yes. I’m 210 now. Yep.”</p>
