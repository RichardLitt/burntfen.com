<p>Trello isnâ€™t working for me.</p>

<p>I have an Agile board for my life, which I have been using regularly for around six months. I have these lists:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>Bwat</strong>. This is borrowed from Paul Farmer, who I read about in the amazing book <em>Mountains Beyond Mountains</em>. Basically, he would tick off a box (called <em>bwat</em> in Haitian Creole) whenever he did something. I like this idea, and it reminds me to try and do actually meaningful things (because all of Paul Farmerâ€™s work is, and mine so often isnâ€™t).</li>
  <li><strong>Today</strong>. This is supposedly what I plan to do that day, but often it is instead simply a list of small tasks that I want to do. It is almost never a list of things I need to do that day, and it never approaches the scope of things I want to do. Instead, it is normally two or three hours worth of random things, after which I do the actual work after those are done. This isnâ€™t efficient. I try and put an amount in that I can do in a day, but most days I forget. The worst part is that I end up with tons of little boxes saying â€˜Read Hacker Newsâ€™, or some other newsletter, which swiftly leads to fatigue as reading a lot of small articles becomes exhausting.</li>
  <li><strong>Later</strong>. This is more often than not blocked items, or things I want to do tomorrow - right now, there are four of those: <em>code</em>, <em>exercise</em>, <em>journal</em>, and <em>inbox zero</em>. Since I do these daily, I constantly move them between Today and Later, and just create a new ticket each day for each after I complete them. I never look through my archived tickets, so this isnâ€™t so wasteful as it seems.</li>
  <li><strong>To Do</strong>. This is basically an in folder, where everything goes. And I mean everything that doesnâ€™t go intoâ€¦</li>
  <li><strong>Code, Physical To Do, Reading, Writing, Ideas, Blog Lists, Deferred Shopping Lists</strong>, and <strong>Long Term</strong>. Anything that goes in these lists - with the possible exception of coding - is swiftly forgotten about.</li>
</ul>

<p>So, this isnâ€™t great. And I think I need to change it up. I have a list of projects in my To Do folder (along with a ton of PDFs I will never, ever read). I update it every few months. What I ought to be doing is mixing this in with my Trello list. Instead of segmenting things into â€˜do nowâ€™, â€˜do at some pointâ€™, and the â€˜do never but nice ideaâ€™ categories, I should have cards for each project, and then have lists inside them with actionable items. At the start of each day, I should decide what projects to work on that day (of course, overwhelmingly, this will be my main job, building <a href="https://github.com/BeagleLab/voyage">Beagle</a>). Then, I should decide what actionables for that day are possible, and move them out of the list using the â€˜convert to cardâ€™ mechanism, and start taking them on.</p>

<p>This loosely follows the <a href="http://hamberg.no/gtd/">Get Things Done</a> philosophy, which I like. Hopefully, itâ€™ll cut down on admin and job bloat.</p>

<p>Another thing I should start doing - well, that I have started doing since I started writing this post - is to organize my daily tasks better. Iâ€™ve just made a little node module called <a href="https://github.com/RichardLitt/practice">Practice</a>, which prints out the keys to an object if their values are false - that is, if I havenâ€™t done a task yet, it lets me know. Iâ€™ve set  this up with GeekTool so that I can actually see the items on my desktop, where Iâ€™ll notice them. I hate having things on my desktop, so this will be pretty good motivation to do my daily tasks.</p>

<p>So, hereâ€™s to shaking up my to do lists.</p>
