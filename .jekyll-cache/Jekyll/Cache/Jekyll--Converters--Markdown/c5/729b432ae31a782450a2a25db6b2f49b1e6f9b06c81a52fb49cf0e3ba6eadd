<p>I can now finally release my newest project, <a href="http://www.bushwhich.com">Bushwhich</a>, a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure set in Bushwick, my neighborhood in Brooklyn.</p>

<p>On January 7th, I made a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/richard.littauer/posts/4382686000497">post on Facebook</a> offering to make five of my friends a special, unique, handmade gift, if they promised to pay it forward at some point. For my friend David Deacon, I made a set of cards that provide interesting fact for each family of squid. For Sarah Hunt, I wrote a poem. For my friends Alex and Joe, I wanted to make a game. Joe works as a sound designer, Alex as a sound masterer. I didnâ€™t think Iâ€™d be able to make something worth their while audio-wise, but I know they both like video games. They kept asking me how living in NY is, and I decided to show them.</p>

<p>After I bought a new camera, I had an idea. I borrowed my friend Sam for a day, and we rode all around Bushwick, going to my favourite spots, taking photos the whole time. By the end, I had around 350 photographs detailing most of the cool haunts I like. This was a pretty fun use of a day, and involved getting pretty drunk. Then the real work began.</p>

<p>For the past few months, Iâ€™ve been working in my spare time setting up the site. I didnâ€™t want to make it too complicated - while Iâ€™m primarily a front-end developer, I thought that building a complex Javascript site that logged clicks and the like would quickly spiral into a massive project that wouldnâ€™t be finished for years. So, I built the entire site in simple HTML and CSS. I used <a href="http://jekyllbootstrap.com/">Jekyll Bootstrap</a>, a fantastic free static site blogging platform that runs on <a href="http://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a>. This site is built using the same software, as is <a href="http://www.mellowpageslibrary.com">MellowPagesLibrary</a>, another site Iâ€™ve built recently for my neighborhood library. I spent a few days building a custom theme, and trying to change the automation process (I wanted to publish folios, not posts, etc). After a while, I settled on a good way of doing it. So, I imported all of the photos, shrank them all to a decent size - good enough to be used as a decent desktop background in case someone like the picture, but small enough to not destroy a good internet connection. I used bash to build a fancy regex that automatically developed all of the posts needed to generate each page.</p>

<p>Then I spent hours and hours and days writing every page, planning out how the route would go. I didnâ€™t draw a map to help, figuring it would be more fun if I got lost, too. Finally, last night, I finished every route. There may be a few bugs here and there - but on the whole, it should work. Thereâ€™s a lot of options - going to the laundromat, to buy cigarettes, watching Harry Potter, eating at Bushwick Living Room, at Swallow, at Cainâ€™s, at Alaska, going to Manhattan, dying in the subway on the way to Far Fockaway, getting sucked in by hipsters in McKibben Lofts, fixing your bike. Itâ€™s an adventure.</p>

<p>I hope you all like it. Initial feedback from Alex and Joe indicate theyâ€™re happy. So, I am too.</p>
