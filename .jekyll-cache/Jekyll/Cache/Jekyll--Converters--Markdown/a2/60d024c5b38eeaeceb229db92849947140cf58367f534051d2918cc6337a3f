<p>After the Marathon, we came to the Globe.</p>

<p>The Globe. is awesome.</p>

<p>There is a really nice selection of books in the bookstore. There are
lots of pamphlets and cool things to look at. Myself, I bought <em>what
matters most is how well you walk through the fire</em> by Bukowski.
Depressing, but good reading.</p>

<p>The back bit has a really nice menu, complete with Spinach burgers and
Nachos, both of which I tried. I had becherovka, a Czech drink, which,
as my friend put it, has â€˜the taste of Christmas and gasoline.â€™ You
know, he wasnâ€™t wrong. The Mexican coffee, with Kahlua, is also
fantastic. At Czech prices, weâ€™ve been here all day. I spent most of
that reading a paper on the <a href="http://scholarspace.manoa.hawaii.edu/bitstream/handle/10125/4506/beyer_beck.pdf?sequence=1">Munji language in Afghanistan</a> (very fun), and a lot of
[Harry Potter and the Methods of Rationality] (hpmor.com) (more fun). Smoking is cool inside, and
the music ainâ€™t half bad. Before - James Bond themes. Now - Fatboy Slim.</p>

<p>Wireless is excellent. 
Plugs are good. 
Chairs are comfortable.</p>

<p>And once again I sacrifice seeing another city for happiness.</p>
