<p>I worked with Bad Wolf to create a Mulefa language for the HBO/BBC series <em>His Dark Materials</em>, based on the Phillip Pullman novels. I created a working language and translated lines as needed for the elephantine creatures in the third season. I was also able to go to the studios in Cardiff and meet some of the actors, which was quite fun.</p>
