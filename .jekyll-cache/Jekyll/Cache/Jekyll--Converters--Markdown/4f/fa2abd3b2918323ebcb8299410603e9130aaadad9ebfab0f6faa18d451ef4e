<p>Scientists spend a lot of time researching, but little of that knowledge ends up in the publication pipeline; by building a system to capture, understand, and share lost data, we can facilitate science as a whole. The idea behind Beagle is that a good PDF Annotator in a minimally-intrusive system (in this case, a Chrome Extension) would allow for data to be shared easier between labs working on specific projects. I was the sole developer contracted on this project for 8 months, using Open Annotator, PDF.js, React, browserify, MongoDB, and other pretty sweet tools to build it out. The project is currently in hiatus while I pursue other projects, although we do have plans to continue it in the future.</p>

<p>The name is from the HMS Beagle, the ship that Charles Darwin used to sail to the Galapagos, and on which he made his revolutionary discoveries.</p>
