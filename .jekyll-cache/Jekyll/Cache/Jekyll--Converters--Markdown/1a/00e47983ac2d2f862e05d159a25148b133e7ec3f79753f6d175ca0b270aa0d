<p>In 2015 I went to Bali and met a taxi driver who asked me how I could help him build a better taxi business. At the time, I was in a hammer-meet-nail mindset, so I did what I normally do - I built a website. I donâ€™t know if it worked, but Iâ€™m hoping he got some rides. At some point, I hope to go back and ask if he is still there in Ubud, and if this actually helped or not. I wrote up a Medium post of the experience, although the website has now expired and I havenâ€™t kept it open.</p>
