<p>Well, as you may have noticed, I completely reworked this site. A few reasons why - Iâ€™m a front end developer now, and I was kind of ashamed of the inherently bootstrappy feel of the last site. This should be a bit better. Iâ€™m also tired of updating this blog and then burntfen.com. So, Iâ€™ve integrated them together. This site will be moved over to that address (as well as rlittauer.com), as well, so this is a major consolidation.</p>

<p>Also, I really didnâ€™t feel like the old sites showed everything as well as they could. I kept a few things - for instance, the movable buttons beneath my profile, which is kind of a UX disaster, but I like the dynamic nature of it. I like the top bar off of this much more, and I like using Font Awesome to get the icons down. You can probably tell that this is based loosely (or not) on <a href="zachholman.com">Zach Holmanâ€™s site</a>. I like it. I also like my little oval image at the top. Seems cool.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve also reorganised the way I was mentally viewing posts. Expect less pages, and more posts. Iâ€™m far too changeable to keep updated pages and pages of things.</p>

<p>Alright, with that done, I can start blogging again.</p>

<p>Expect more.</p>
