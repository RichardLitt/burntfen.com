<p>After I had built the <a href="../learn-navi">Na’vi Dictionary</a> and was working on <a href="../dothraki">Dothraki</a>, I wanted to try building my own language. The result was Llárriésh, a strange language that is almost impossible to speak. I built it during a couple of months when I was trapped in Princeton, NJ, working at an ice cream shop.</p>
