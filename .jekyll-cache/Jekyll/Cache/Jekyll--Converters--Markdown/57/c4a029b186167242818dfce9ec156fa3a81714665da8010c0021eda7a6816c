<p>I recieved a book in the mail today, called <a href="http://code-poems.com/book.html">Code {Poems}</a>. 
It is the 54th copy out of 100 copies printed in the first edition. 
On page 18, the following is written:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>IMPORT SOUL  

# This script should save lives  

import soul  

for days in len(life):  
  print happiness  
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>At the bottom of the page is my name, and beneath it, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">// Python</code>, 
the language the poem is written in This marks the first time that I’ve
seen my name in print in a book or a journal of poetry that wasn’t
connected to my educational establishment - in short, today is the first
day I am officially a published poet.</p>
