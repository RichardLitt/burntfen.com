<p>On the Metro in Paris,<br />
I imagine her thoughts<br />
and her destination.<br />
Then, I see her<br />
fingers<br />
drumming lightly<br />
on the metal pole;<br />
And the wide gulf<br />
between synapses and nerves<br />
opens before me.</p>

<p>If that hand<br />
held this hand,<br />
this ocean would be<br />
just lightly pinched.</p>
