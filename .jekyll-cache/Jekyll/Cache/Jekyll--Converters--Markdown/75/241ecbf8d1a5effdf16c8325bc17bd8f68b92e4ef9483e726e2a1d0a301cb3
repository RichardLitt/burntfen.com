<p>Iâ€™m studying for my Foundations exam. I had some stray thoughts that
might be worth sharing, and thatâ€™ll help me remember things.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>missed</em> is a homophone to <em>mist</em>. I should write a poem about that.
Why? Because mist is one of my favourite things, and staring into
it, a lot of things are arbitrarily called to the mind. Cf. TS Eliotâ€™s
poem â€˜Marinaâ€™ for what I mean.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I still think that morphology ought to be more important in language
evolution. I wonder what lines of thinking would lead to if you
followed down the route that starts with the thought that morphology
sits at the interface of lexicon, phonology, and syntax - does that make
it a fossil itself? What is the nature of theoretical detritus - is it
more likely to be isolated or joined onto existing patterns?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I should use regular expressions more in NLP for Wired. For
instance, in t = â€˜two minutes and five secondsâ€™, I should use
minutes and then split(â€˜ â€˜) and then use t[x-1] to identify,
instead of currently saving slots 1 and 4 for retrieval. Just saying.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
