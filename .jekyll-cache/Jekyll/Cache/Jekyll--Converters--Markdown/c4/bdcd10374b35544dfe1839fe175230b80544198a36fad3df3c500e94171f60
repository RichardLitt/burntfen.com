<h2 id="from-psalm-23">From Psalm 23.</h2>
<p><em>By me and Jolene.</em></p>

<p>The Lord is my sysadmin, I shall not grep.<br />
He makes me use languages with many libraries,<br />
he allows me to apt-get many packages,<br />
he clears my cache. <br />
He echoes my global path,<br />
for his user names klout.<br />
Even though I tech-support other peopleâ€™s code,<br />
I will fear no project manager,<br />
for you are with me;<br />
your root access and your admin powers,<br />
they comfort me.<br />
You oai-pmh my repository,<br />
in the presence of my 4chan trolls.<br />
You chmod my files as 777,<br />
my stack overfloweth.<br />
Surely your goodness and wireless network will follow me<br />
all the days of my life,<br />
I will subscribe to your mailing list<br />
for(int days = 0; days &lt;= eternity; days++);<br />
I will be in your usergroup.</p>
