<p>I haven’t used this blog in a while, but I want to do so again, for a couple of reasons:</p>

<ul>
  <li>I don’t like the old journal system I had set up. It leads to me not knowing where is what.</li>
  <li>I don’t want to split attention across dozens of journals for my readers, either.</li>
  <li>I don’t think that having a coherent blog is as important as it is. I think that posts are more interesting. I don’t go to websites anymore - I get newsletters. So, I’d rather write posts, put them somewhere, and then send a newsletter. It makes more sense, to me, than trying to curate a nice blog.</li>
  <li>I don’t want my content to be stuck in a newsletter, either, or on a WordPress site. Using a blog as a repository fixes that.</li>
</ul>

<p>So! This will be the blog, psot-dump, journal, common book, whatever you want to call it. Let’s get to making it, now.</p>

<p>So - here is a new post. Where does it go? Ok, <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">rake post</code> creates a new post at http://127.0.0.1:4000/2019-02-21/revamping-the-old-blog. Interesting. And the Archive page appears to be the listing. Let’s copy <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">archive.html</code> to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">blog.html</code> and reset the links in the footer, and just use this format. It seems to work.</p>

<p>There. Done that. And:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Added some information to the top of the blog page, and linked to my tinyletters.</li>
  <li>Gone through and added tags to old blog posts that didn’t have them, and deleted at least one empty post.</li>
  <li>Decided against deleting or excising my blogs from before 2015. Let my past stand as it is.</li>
  <li>Edited this post.</li>
</ul>

<p>I’m not going to add a link on the front page, for now. Perhaps at some other time. For the open source work, I’ll make a post on Medium to showcase what I am doing; I don’t think it needs a permanent home, yet. For larger announcements, I’ve always found that Medium works fine. Hell, Twitter works fine - just link to a post elsewhere. This place should do, too. People can just link to my post here (why use Medium at all?).</p>

<p>Great.</p>

<p>Alright. We’re good to start blogging again. Excellent. And now, let’s go to bed, it’s almost 5:00am.</p>
