<p>I just tried to get Mou to run in the terminal. <a href="http://mouapp.com/">Mou</a> is actually a pretty
lovely program that allows you to see what a document with Markdown
syntax looks like as you type it, something like an instant TeX
compiler. I use Markdown on this blog, and on Github Wikis, so it’s
proven useful. It’s the main reason I upgraded to Mountain Lion - I wish
I hadn’t, as they killed spaces, which in turn killed my entire
productivity flow. I look forward to more updates, as I can’t do other
things anymore, such as have a transparent vim workspace.</p>

<p>I just tried this:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>sudo ln -s /Applications/Mou.app/Contents/MacOS/mou /usr/bin/mou
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This should have worked. Instead, I got this error:</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>No Info.plist file in application bundle or no NSPrincipalClass in the Info.plist file, exiting
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>I then tried using ‘echo test &gt; test’ ‘open App…/mou test’. No dice,
as it instead opened test in mvim, and Mou opened nothing. So,
basically, I can’t open things from Mou in the terminal.</p>

<p>Of course, then I googled it.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>open -a Mou test.md
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>And we have it. For future reference, Richard, Google stuff first, you
knob.</p>
