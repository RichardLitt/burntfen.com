<p>Today I did something Iâ€™ve been meaning to do for a long time. I drew some more entries in the style of the <a href="https://burntfen.com/comic">Burnt Fen Maunderings</a>, my old webcomic. These are a different me - older, somewhat more minimal, much less depressed but still overly reflective.</p>

<p>All of these are for sale. Let me know if youâ€™re interested.</p>
