<p>I made a choose-your-own-adventure photography game around my old neighborhood in Brooklyn. This was just a fun little project to show my hood to friends of mine who asked what living in New York was like, done over a weekend with a friend, biking around with my camera and getting drinks, and then coding it all up using Jekyll. A more extensive write-up is <a href="https://burntfen.com/2013-12-22/12-08-bushwhich/">here</a>.</p>

<p>In total, the game has had over 2500 sessions and over 40k pageviews, which isnâ€™t bad for a weekends work and a couple of dollars spent on some whiskey and coke.</p>
