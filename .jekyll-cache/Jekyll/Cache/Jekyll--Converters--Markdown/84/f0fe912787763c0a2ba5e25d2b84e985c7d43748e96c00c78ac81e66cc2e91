<p>Over a year ago (but not much over), a friend and I were sitting in one
of my favourite cafÃ©s at the time, Black Medicine, in Bruntsfield,
Edinburgh. We were talking about Twitter, and about what sort of posts
were allowed â€“ and what sort werenâ€™t. We began to wonder: what if we
had private twitter accounts, and no followers? What would the posts
be like?</p>

<p>A pact began to form. We both set up new accounts, and didnâ€™t tell the
other their names. We promised to never follow anyone; to never tweet at
anyone; to never retweet each other or anyone who might be able to
identify us; to not talk about it, except in generalities; to tweet when
we wanted, but never because we felt obligated to. At the end of the
year, weâ€™d see who had more followers, and what the tweets looked like.</p>

<p>A year passed.</p>

<p>My friend, @simonv3 (his public account), won the contest, with four
followers. We have no idea why any of them followed him. I had no
followers - and frankly, Iâ€™m not surprised.</p>

<p>No, Iâ€™m not going to give you the name of my account. This is largely because around 95% of my private tweets were swear words. Around 20% of them arenâ€™t fit for public consumption, and around 10% of them are midly socially incriminating. But in between the drunken rants and swears, thereâ€™s a few very tender moments. Posts about how much I miss people; or home; or a girl. Posts that really show what exactly I was feeling at the time, and some that show how quickly a mood can change. Posts that speak of the heights and lows of last year (one of the most dynamic in my life, I suppose.)</p>

<p>While Iâ€™m not going to post the twitter handle here; if youâ€™re a good
friend, and are brave enough to risk being told <em>Sorry, No</em> to (Iâ€™m not giving it
out to everyone), feel free to ask for it. If youâ€™re curious as to what
<em>you</em> might do - well, I suggest setting up your own account. Iâ€™ve
learned a lot - mainly, Iâ€™ve learned what social networks really mean,
and how the old adage of â€˜I tweet about my breakfastâ€™ only holds up when
you know others are listening.</p>

<p>For the record: there were no tweets about breakfast.</p>
