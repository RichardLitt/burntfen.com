<p>The Open Source Collective is a non-profit umbrella organisation (501c6) providing financial and legal infrastructure for over three thousand open source projects, and counting. It is part of the <a href="https://opencollective.com/">Open Collective</a> project, which is making it easier for people to send and receive money as a collective without having to jump through modern banking hoops.</p>

<p>I am helping us figure out how to best serve the needs of open source projects, by providing resources, enabling fund transfer, and building a community of open source developers. Together, we’re influencing the entire field of open source.</p>

<p>I’ve been working with Open Collective for years - largely with <a href="/projects/sustain">Sustain</a> and the <a href="/projects/diginf/">Digital Infrastructure Fund</a>, which I run as part of this work.</p>
