<p><em>Note: I am uncomfortable releasing such a small, poor, non-literary review. I feel like this book deserves more. But these are the thoughts I wrote down, and theyâ€™re true, and thatâ€™s sometimes enough.</em></p>

<p>This book was utterly superb. I did not expect to love it as much as I did. Pollaidh lent it to me years ago, before COVID, even. I didnâ€™t take advantage of it as I wish I had - I found it ponderous and slow. But now, post-pandemic, I found it a welcome book to dive into. Finneganâ€™s prose is quick, immaculate, and engaging. His breadth of vocabulary, his descriptions of the wave, and his dedication towards surfing were fascinating to read. I wanted to surf. I felt like I was reading about birding. I understood the drive and the obsession, immediately.</p>

<p>More than that - he drew me in. I almost cried reading about his journeys as a young man, his vagrancy, his vagabonding across the world in those beautiful places. I felt a kinship with him, and a desire to go, too, something Iâ€™ve always wanted for myself. I remember my own times hitching around Europe, my times on Maya, all of it. It was rosy as all hell. I loved it. I yearned for his youth, because it reminded me of mine, because I wasnâ€™t ready to be here, either.</p>

<p>I was never bored. Only intensely interested. Like Abbey, I felt that I was seeing a glimpse of a world now gone. Iâ€™m curious where the waves are that people are surfing, alone. Iâ€™m curious about whether this is all tinted glasses or not. Youth is beautiful, wherever it is.</p>

<p>What a book. So many words. I want to read it again. I donâ€™t want to give it away. Beautiful. Just beautiful. I realized I am not a surfer. But I want to be.</p>
