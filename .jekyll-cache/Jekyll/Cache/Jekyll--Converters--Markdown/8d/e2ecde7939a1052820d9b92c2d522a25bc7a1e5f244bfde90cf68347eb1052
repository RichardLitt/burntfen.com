<p>Recently Iâ€™ve been trying to do lists the long way instead of the longer
way. That is to say, if I have a chunk of text that I need to copy
somewhere, and itâ€™s not in a good format, I take the time to figure out
the regex for it so that I get faster at using regex, rather than just
doing it manually. In some cases, this is far shorter - I recently
converted a very long dictionary easily after around thirty minutes
figuring out a regex for it. Just now, I did something similar, but I
could have just deleted some segments a lot faster.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>:%s/\s\([A-Z][a-z]*\)\s\S*\s\S*\s\S*\s\S*/\1\r/gc
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>This basically took a proper noun - in this case, a Japanese town - with
for words after it, and removed them, and put it on a new line. As you
can tell, Iâ€™m using vim. Favourite thing I learned here? \S - anything
but \s. I also love () and \1, but thatâ€™s just a given, innit?</p>
