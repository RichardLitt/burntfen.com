I"4	
<p>I have discontinued use of my old blog, as I haven’t posted there in
months. However, there was a feature on that blog, and on my old
notebook system where I had a locally-installed Wordpress, which I
rather miss - namely, project pages. I haven’t had a page which keeps
track of all of my various projects and my various lines of research,
something which is necessary for me to keep track of all of my
activities. Yesterdy morning at 4, after trying to bang something out in
text to figure out how I was going to submit papers worth reading to
NAACL-HLT and ACL, I realised I needed to make a new site to keep track
of things again.</p>

<p>So, I’ve revamped this one today, and it only took me around 10 hours or
so. I’ve redone the navigation bar, as you can see, and I’ve created
pages for each of the research areas I am interested in. In each page is
a list of the subtopics, within that area, that I would like to, have,
or am currently researching. For projects, I’ve listed projects I am
currently on, ones I do for fun, and those I do for language
development. I am going to fill these pages out, in time.</p>

<p>Here are pages I wrote tonight:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://richardlitt.github.com/about.html">About</a> this site and me</li>
  <li><a href="http://richardlitt.github.com/art.html">Art</a> that I do</li>
  <li><a href="http://richardlitt.github.com/fun-stuff.html">Fun projects</a> I’ve
done or do currently.</li>
</ul>

<p>I will work on filling the others out, and hopefully, this site will
function as a much more lively place for me to show research that I am
doing, on a daily basis. This may seem vain or self-important, in that I
am releasing all of this information into the public domain - for me, I
think that the benefits from other people seeing projects I am working
on and possible collaborations coming from that, as well as the benefit
of feeling connected to a community and being able to use web interfaces
and grab information I need whenever far outweigh any negative
reprecussions of having so much information online.</p>

<p>I’m looking forward to seeing much more use of this site, now that this
step of completely moving over has occurred. I suspect that, when
January rolls around, I will move the <a href="rlittauer.com">Burnt Fen</a> over
here, as well. Simplify, simplify.</p>
