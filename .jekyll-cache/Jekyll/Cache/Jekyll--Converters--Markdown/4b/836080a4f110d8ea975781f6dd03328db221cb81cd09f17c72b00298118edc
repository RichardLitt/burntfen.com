<p>Today I learned about <a href="https://www.gittip.com/">Gittip</a> from my good pal <a href="https://www.gittip.com/simonv3">Simon</a>.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s a pretty sweet idea. You give people a set tip per week if you like there stuff - as small as 25Â¢ - and then they can get tipped from that. Very simple. Go check it out.</p>
