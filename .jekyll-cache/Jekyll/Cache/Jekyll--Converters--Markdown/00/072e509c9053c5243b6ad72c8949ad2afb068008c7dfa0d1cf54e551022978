<p>I’ve been reading through some of the papers on <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/~mjkay/">Martin Kay’s website</a>, as he is teaching Basic Algorithms for Computational Linguistics here. He has a paper about <em>n</em>-grams and the upper limit, and ways of getting past it. In it, he talks about language models, and the current way of using <em>n</em>-grams to generate natural language. He ends with this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>But could it be that the standard statistic is not only difficult to
use, but also not the best one for the job? A very different one,
which may be easier to use is the probability of the substring, given
the bag of words that make it up. In other words, it is the number of
instances of the substring in the training data, divided by the number
of sentences that contain all of the words in it.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Consider a string S that contains substrings s1,s2…sk, all of
which are also substrings of the training corpus, that are maximal
with respect to S. Might the figure of merit of the substrings f1,
f2…fk, be assinging in such a way that the fom of S would be f1</p>
  <ul>
    <li>f2…+fk, or something comparably simple?</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>

<p>I think this is the right reasoning, but I also think it may not go far
enough. One of the interesting things about the <em>n</em>-gram model is that
it is generally used for words, but not necessarily for substrings that
are composed of other substrings - as far as I am aware. If this is the
case, then it might be possible to train an algorithm that would not
only give the best fit strings from the bag of words, but also rank the
substrings that are collated as being more probable together. You would
need a massive amount of corpora for this to be the case, of course.</p>

<p>But a way of getting around this block might be to use annotated
substrings that have some sort of intelligent understand of the
collocations within them, possible using semantic or syntactic
annotation. If this were to be done, coreference and anaphoric
resolution would be a bootstrapper to predicting the correct choice of
substrings, and the current best-first model would be surpassed in favor
of a more cohesive output. By taking the the substring with the
probability of the words within coming from within the previous bag of
words, and then checking this substring against the surrounding
substrings <em>against the possibility of these collocations existing in
the training data</em> (and possibly even the already given strings), it
should be possible to have more probably generation.</p>
