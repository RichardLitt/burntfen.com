<p>I buy a lot of random marathon training books in used bookstores. This was one of those - $2.50 on the shelf. At the time, this seems like a stupid purchase. Why should I throw these into my cart, when Iâ€™ve got others at home and I may not even get to it?</p>

<p>Consider if I do set aside time to skim it. If I learn one good tip, something that changes how I think and what I do, would that be worth the $2.50? Almost certainly. Nonfiction books, and particularly how-to books, are, from this standpoint, a great investment.</p>

<p>Even if they are run of the mill, middle of the road books like this one. Kuehls wasnâ€™t preaching to the Olympic trainers, but to your average joe. He didnâ€™t want to make anyone change to a fad diet (â€œA word about fad diets while you are training for your 4-hour marathon: DONâ€™Tâ€) or try a different type of new shoe. All of the advice here is what youâ€™d find in a couple of blogs on Runnerâ€™s World, if you were looking for your most conservative running advice. And not if you were trying to be <strong>elite</strong> (a word he bolds, too.) For instance, when talking about runners drinking before a marathon: â€œThey [are] Olympic runners. Their metabolisms are different than ours.â€</p>

<p>I would consider a lot of the advice poor, too. For instance, he says that carbohydrates are the only fuel for your body. Thatâ€™s not true, scientifically - you can also use fats and proteins. But he discards any conflicting science there. In fact, thereâ€™s not much science in this 100-page book, at all. Itâ€™s all written as â€œDo this. Donâ€™t do that.â€ No justifications, just advice. An example: â€œStop drinking caffeine three days before the run.â€ But that would probably kill me - withdrawal from caffeine can take over a week.</p>

<p>That having been said, I picked up some good tips. First, buy three pairs of shoes, and break one in with 6-7 short runs, and then use that for your race. Switch the other shoes up each run - this allows them to air out, extends the life, and lets the shock absorbers rebound. Buy 8-10 pair of white cotton ankle socks. Iâ€™m surprised I havenâ€™t done this - I use long black socks, which are too thin. Do your Saturday long run in the same timezone as your marathon, and have a meal (preferably brunch) after to refuel.</p>

<p>Writing this review may have taken more time than I took skimming the book. Thatâ€™s OK. I picked up what I did where I needed it, and discarded the rest. Still worth the time and money.</p>
