<p>I am currently working on:</p>

<div class="current-project">
<h1>My Masters' Thesis</h1>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/RichardLitt/thesis">ðŸ”—</a>
</p>
</div>

<p>This is titled <em>Open Source Code and Low Resource Languages</em>, for my MSc in Computational Linguistics at the Saarland University in Germany. Follow along on that repository.</p>

<h3 id="why-does-this-page-exist">Why does this page exist?</h3>

<p>I only have a limited amount of time - not only in my day to day life, but also on this planet. Past experience has shown me that I canâ€™t afford to have my time split between too many projects. Instead, I need to choose a single project, and make that what I am doing, at the expense of all of the others.</p>

<p>If I donâ€™t guard my time zealously, I find that it is sapped between ten thousand different things, and I canâ€™t focus on anything. This page - a public statement on what I am working on - is my response to this threat.</p>

<p>This is kind of like an autoresponder, but I wanted to have more information than just one line.</p>

<h3 id="where-can-i-keep-updated-on-your-status">Where can I keep updated on your status?</h3>

<p>Right here. Iâ€™ll send out a weekly email with updates, too. Follow along at <a href="http://tinyletter.com/richlitt">http://tinyletter.com/richlitt</a>.</p>

<p>Or hit me up on Twitter <a href="https://twitter.com/richlitt">@richlitt</a>. I check it during my office hours, normally.</p>

<h3 id="when-do-you-work-on-this-project">When do you work on this project?</h3>

<p>I am working on this project every day, normally until 13:00 at my local time zone (normally EST). All other projects are slated for my office hours between 14:00 and 17:00.</p>

<h3 id="when-do-you-do-other-stuff">When do you do other stuff?</h3>

<p>14:00-17:00. I just said that.</p>

<h3 id="so-you-dont-want-to-do-x-anymore">So you donâ€™t want to do X anymore?</h3>

<p>Not necessarily. I may have some small time for it. Iâ€™ve set aside a couple of hours each day to get to other projects and to concerns like yours.</p>

<h3 id="when-will-you-get-to-x">When will you get to X?</h3>

<p>I donâ€™t know. I havenâ€™t decided on whether or not Iâ€™ll make a schedule public, as a schedule implies that Iâ€™ll get to something later. Iâ€™m not interested in whatâ€™s after this - Iâ€™m only interesting in the task in front of me.</p>

<h3 id="i-really-need-your-feedback-now">I really need your feedback, now.</h3>

<p>If you want an answer to something immediately, send me an email with the word <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">dragon</code> in the title. No reason this canâ€™t be fun.</p>

<h3 id="im-your-client">Iâ€™m your client.</h3>

<p>Oh. I <strong>should</strong> have flagged your email for my work hours. Please let me know as soon as possible if Iâ€™ve missed something. Keyword for your email: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">coins</code>.</p>

<h3 id="i-want-to-help-with-one-of-your-projects">I want to help with one of your projects!</h3>

<p>Thatâ€™s awesome! Get in touch immediately! Maybe include the word <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">griffin</code> in the title of your email?</p>

<h3 id="can-i-sponsor-your-projects-you-do-cool-stuff">Can I sponsor your projects? You do cool stuff.</h3>

<p>Absolutely. <a href="https://www.patreon.com/richlitt">Here is my Patreon</a>. Let me know if you want to help another way - Iâ€™m all ears. Keyword for your email: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">loot</code>.</p>

<h3 id="this-is-an-incredibly-pretentious-autoresponder-and-i-find-you-pretentious-too">This is an incredibly pretentious autoresponder, and I find you pretentious, too.</h3>

<p>Thatâ€™s OK. I hope you find happiness today, however you can!</p>
