<p>Youâ€™re at a new cafe. You havenâ€™t signed onto the wifi before, so you ask the barista what the password is.</p>

<p>â€œOh, no password. Just â€œHipsterCafeWIFIâ€. Itâ€™s open.â€</p>

<p>Great.</p>

<p>So, you open your laptop, and connect to the network. You refresh gmail. Nothing happens. You refresh Facebook. Nothing. Still says youâ€™re signed off.</p>

<p>At this exact moment, what do you do?</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s only one real solution; try and find a non-SSL site. SSL is a fancy way of saying using <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https</code> - a more secure protocol for sharing information. You see, Gmail, Facebook, Twitter â€” the sites youâ€™re on most often - all have <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https</code> enabled and enforced. This means that you canâ€™t be redirected through to the log-in page that HipsterCafeWIFI requires. Thereâ€™s a button you need to press on that page to get into the wifi, though. So you need to find a site that has only <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">http</code>, and not <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">https</code>, in the URL in order for this button to pop up.</p>

<p>I have a site I always go to: <a href="http://sadyoungman.com">sadyoungman.com</a>. Itâ€™s mine, and I havenâ€™t enabled SSL on it. I asked around on Twitter, and thereâ€™s a few sites other people use.</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://purple.com">purple.com</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://ismercuryinretrograde.com">ismercuryinretrograde.com</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://omniglot.com">omniglot.com</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://example.com">example.com</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://neverssl.com.">neverssl.com</a></li>
</ul>

<p><a href="http://example.com">Example.com</a> makes the most sense - itâ€™s actually run by the people who run the internet (thatâ€™s a super simplified way of putting it, of course). But I hadnâ€™t heard of NeverSSL before. It was made specifically for this purpose. If you need a site that doesnâ€™t have SSL enabled, go there. End of thread, really.</p>

<p>Of course, if that doesnâ€™t work and youâ€™re not sure why, Mercury may be in retrograde, so maybe you should check that site, too.</p>
