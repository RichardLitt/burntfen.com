<p>I recently bought <a href="http://sadyoungman.com">sadyoungman.com</a>.</p>

<p>I have no idea what to do with it. For a month it just redirected here. Now I have a picture up, at least.</p>

<p>I tried to make the back-end code as minimal as possible. https://github.com/RichardLitt/sad-young-man</p>

<p>Thoughts?</p>
