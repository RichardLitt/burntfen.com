<p>Some birds seen in Vermont may not have a subspecies level; some cannot safely be identified as a specific subspecies; some can only be safely identified in hand; and some are the nominate subspecies, but not commonly reported as a subspecies, particularly on eBird.</p>

<p>Here, I’m trying to list what I know about subspecies identification. I hope to grow this, in time. If you have comments, please email <a href="mailto:richard@burntfen.com">richard@burntfen.com</a> and I’d love to chat to you about this!</p>

<p>For the most part, I am interested in birds which can be logged on <a href="https://ebird.org">eBird</a> using a subspecies identification. However, there are cases where eBird doesn’t have that option, due to difficulties in the field. I hope to tease those out here, too.</p>

<ul>
  <li>X Northern Cardinal: <em>Heard, seen.</em></li>
  <li>X <strong>Northern Cardinal (Common)</strong>: <em>Male: Breast brighter red than crest. Female: Black face mask, neither grey nor white.</em></li>
  <li>X <strong>Red-eyed/Philadelphia Vireo</strong>: <em>Unable to visually identify.</em></li>
  <li>X Philadelphia Vireo: <em>Unable to visually identify, but song clearly higher and slower than REVI.</em></li>
  <li>X Philadelphia Vireo: <em>Visually identified.</em></li>
  <li>X Red-eyed Vireo: <em>Visually identified.</em></li>
  <li>X Rock Pigeon (Feral Pigeon): <em>No comment.</em></li>
  <li>X American Crow: <em>No comment.</em></li>
  <li>X House Sparrow: <em>No comment.</em></li>
  <li>X Northern Flicker: <em>Heard.</em></li>
  <li>X <strong>Northern Flicker (Yellow-shafted)</strong>: <em>Identified by yellow feathers. Cheeks and throat tan, contrasting with gray crown and nape; on the male, malar black and nape crescent red.</em></li>
  <li>X Least Bittern: <em>No comment. Visually identifiable as I. e. exilis given ocherous side of head, creamy yellow wing coverts, but not an option on eBird.</em></li>
