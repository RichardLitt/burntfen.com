<p>As I was cleaning up my desktop this morning, waiting for some program to install work work, I ran across a document I made a couple of days after Thanksgiving, titled <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">things done</code>. This was it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Updated UKLO website</li>
  <li>Wrote redacted about her article.</li>
  <li>Wrote David redacted</li>
  <li>Got some new albums</li>
  <li>i Wrote Pete about about page</li>
  <li>i Wrote Gergo about video icon and deployment</li>
  <li>Emailed David again</li>
  <li>Archived Currents Against Us</li>
  <li>Talked to Aunt Theresa, went on a walk with Uncle Tom</li>
  <li>Decided to make an Angular-Github-Pages repository that will run on Jekyll</li>
  <li>Took a long walk with Uncle Tom</li>
  <li>Said hi to Jordan</li>
  <li>Sat in a coffee house</li>
</ul>

<p>What a day that must have been, most notably for the two separate walks. Why am I posting this? Because this list shows a desire I have to chronicle my days, to make an account of them, to be able to check off things as I do them (even if they werenâ€™t on a checklist before). This is one of the reasons I spent around 5 hours fighting databases to try and get <a href="http://lean.burntfen.com/app/index.html#">Lean</a> working yesterday, which was ultimately a failure. That is more of a to do list program - and the past few months have taught me that my best days as far as productivity goes are days I use a pen and a paper, in an old fashioned list.</p>

<p>How do you keep a list of what you do each day? How do you organise your tasks having been done?</p>
