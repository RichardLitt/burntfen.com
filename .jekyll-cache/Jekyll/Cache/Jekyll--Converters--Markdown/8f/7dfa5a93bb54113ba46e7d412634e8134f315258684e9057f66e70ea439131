<p>I run <a href="https://birdinginvermont.com">Birding in Vermont</a>, a website dedicated towards providing technical tools and resources for birders in Vermont. I have pages about subspecies identification, nocturnal flight call research, maps showing town and county counts which <a href="https://ebird.org">eBird</a> doesnâ€™t provide natively, a checker to see which rare birds need to be reported to the Vermont Bird Records Committee, and more.</p>

<p>I also have several challenges, including the Vermont 251 challenge, where I collect sightings from around Vermont to see if we can bird in every town collectively each year. In 2021 we achieved this collectively for the first time. I also was the first birder (that I know of) to bird in every town and gore in Vermont in one year, largely using the map to show which towns I needed to target.</p>
