<h2 id="books-from-last-year">Books from last year</h2>

<p>I read a lot. This year was no exception. I failed to keep a list, and I moved from New York to San Francisco in June. Iâ€™m not sure what I read in paperback before I moved, so this list isnâ€™t complete. Iâ€™ve also given away some books, and I donâ€™t remember some of those.</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>As You Were: A Punk Comix Anthology</strong> <em>Surprisingly had one of my favourite strips of all time, about a man missing a Mountain Goats concert</em></li>
  <li>Tim Atkins - <strong>Horace</strong> <em>Really quite atrocious</em></li>
  <li>Robert Bringhurst - <strong>A Story As Sharp As A Knife</strong> <em>Incredible work about Haida mythtellers. I wish it was longer</em></li>
  <li>Bruce Chatwin - <strong>What Am I Doing Here</strong> <em>Still the best storyteller Iâ€™ve read</em></li>
  <li>Anderson Cooper - <strong>Dispatches from the Edge</strong> <em>Good</em></li>

  <li>Martin Luther King Jr. - <strong>Where Do We Go From Here: Chaos or Community</strong> <em>Fantastic and still very pertinent read</em></li>
  <li>CS Lewis - <strong>The Great Divorce</strong> <em>Worst book ever</em></li>

  <li>David Troupes - <strong>Parsimony</strong></li>
  <li>Gene Wolfe - <strong>There Are Doors</strong> <em>I gave up on this book the first time Iâ€™ve read it; I read it twice this year. Itâ€™s an incredible fantasy set in 1920s SF or so.</em></li>
