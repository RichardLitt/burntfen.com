<p>With Andreas and Lemar in the Marathon Café in Prague. I’ve continually
wanted to start a blog talking about all of the different cafés I’ve
been to, but I haven’t gotten around to it yet. As this blog as so easy
to push, this post is going here, although it may eventually go on a new
blog, or maybe even on my old <a href="http://www.edinburghcafes.blogspot.com">Edinburgh
Cafes</a> blog, which is really only for
cafes in Edinburgh.</p>

<p>So, here’s the run down:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Two cute girls in the corner</li>
  <li>In a confusing building - might be a uni?</li>
  <li>Wireless good. Also, access to Eduroam as a backup.</li>
  <li>Latte alright, a bit too frothy.</li>
  <li>Very lovely music, computer near the door for selection. Conducive to
sitting and thining. Think lounge music, but not so ungood.</li>
  <li>Chairs, nice. Lights, nice. General atmosphere: chic.</li>
  <li>Food - not sure, haven’t had it. Going to another place now.</li>
  <li>Many outlets for computers.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rating: 4 out of 5.</p>
