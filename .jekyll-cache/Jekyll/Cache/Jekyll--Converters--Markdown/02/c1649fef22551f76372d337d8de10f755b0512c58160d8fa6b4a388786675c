<p>I’ve read <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/709">The Princess and Curdie</a> half a dozen times since I was young; it’s a beautiful story about a young minor who is tasked with traveling to a far-off court to save the Princess. The miner’s beast, bathing his hands in a fire made of roses, his ability to sense the animal inside the humans at court - the story has forever shaped how I read not only fantasy, but also the world. I have a tattoo on my inner left forearm of a hammer, based on Curdie’s mattock (something I don’t mention very often, because who reads George Macdonald anymore?). I’ve read <em>Phantastes</em> and <em>Lilith</em>, too.</p>

<p>But I had somehow never read <em>The Princess and the Curdie</em>. So, a few weeks ago, while I was looking for <em>The Scottish Himalayan Expedition</em> in the McGill library, and when I had some time to kill, I went to find <em>The Lion, The Witch, and the Warddrobe</em> so that I could read about Narnia again, as it was all snow outside and I wanted to imagine Mr Tumnus walking by. Their copy was checked out; but I notcied a beautifully bound book nearby, acquired by the library in 1925 but probably printed before that. I checked it out.</p>

<p>The first few chapters I read aloud to my girlfriend as we lay in bed. We giggled at Macdonald’s old fashion view of princesses and nurses - he goes on and on about how a princess ought to behave, about how, “because she was a princess, she didn’t do X” and so on. The language is spattered with phrases like, “Oh, aren’t you a dear!”, and other such old fashioned language that sounds so odd to a 21st century ear. Reading this aloud proved tiring at some point, so I switched to silent reading.</p>

<p>The book is a gem. It’s short, and a bit confusing at times, but it has within it a few things that are missing from today’s fantasy. For one, it’s not aimed at adults, but children. There are wide open mountains; there are goblins without fangs; there are kings who are Good. You can scatter goblins by stomping on their feet and by making up rhymes. It reminded me of the Brothers Grimm, and their stories - an older, more fairytale setting. There’s even the Princess’s great-great-great fairy grandmother - or, rather, her faery one, for she has no wings, but she has an ineluctable magic that draws one in.</p>

<p>This book is actually the prequel to <em>The Princess and Curdie</em>, so, suddenly, a lot of that book makes sense where it didn’t before. I liked that immensely. I think the second book is deeper - more allegorical, whereas this is much more of a cute narrative than anything else. Still, it was a quick pleasure to read, and especially in a leather-bound hardcover where the section-sewn pages were coming out in yellow clumps, complete with the smell of book must.</p>

<p>As a final note, there were a few fun linguistic items in this book. For instance, one of the Goblins uses the word ‘hubby’, which I had previously assumed was a modernism. It’s not.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“I will do just as I like,” retorted the queen sulkily.
“You ought to do as your hubby wishes you,” said the king.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>That was fun to learn.</p>
