<p>An interesting post ran across my twitter feed this morning:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>cortesi: I want a tool that calculates the cost of following a Twitter user. Something like volume* signal/noise…</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I started thinking
that this is something you could do automatically. Cortesi seems to
already be working on a side project that would add a <em>like</em> button to
tweets, so that he can manually manage which ones he likes and help the
program predict more. I think that this is a good way to go, but the
data deluge may get exhausting training wise, and it depends upon too
much of a conscious choice on the part of the tweeter.</p>

<p>Instead, it might be worthwhile making a program that logs:</p>

<ul>
  <li>when you follow a link on a tweet</li>
  <li>when you reply to a tweet</li>
  <li>when you follow someone new</li>
  <li>when you unfollow someone</li>
  <li>what percentage, of all of these, for each user.</li>
</ul>

<p>Combined, this should work fairly well to let the app know what sort of
information you like on your feed. It doesn’t work for self-contained
tweets which you enjoy, however - in that case, the manual system,
worked out by cortesi, would be best. But still, this would be a major
bootstrapper.</p>

<p>I’m thinking about how I would do it. I would log links followed using a
browser add-on - I’m not sure if Twitter development code allows you to
log followed links (anyone know?) I would also do a simple reply
search to log that, again using the Twitter api. And then perhaps some
basic NLP on those posts to see what sort of thing I’m replying.</p>

<p>How would you do it?</p>
