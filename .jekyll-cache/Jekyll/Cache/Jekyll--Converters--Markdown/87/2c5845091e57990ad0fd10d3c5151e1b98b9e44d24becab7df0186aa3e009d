<p>Mellow Pages Library was a collaborative library that allowed anyone to donate and take out books and become members for free. It existed for two years in Bushwick, Brooklyn, and was run by <em>Matt Nelson</em> and <em>Jacob Perkins</em>. I built and maintained their website for them, and hosted at least one reading at the actual space.</p>

<p>Mellow Pages later closed, and the site is now down, but it continues as a library pop-up at Silent Barn, another venue in Bushwick. <a href="http://theatlasreview.com/mellow-pages-library/">Their new website</a> is now maintained and hosted as part of Atlas Review.</p>
