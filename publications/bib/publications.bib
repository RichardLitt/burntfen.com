Most scientific workflow programs provide a user-friendly graphical user interface that enables scientists to more easily create and visualize complex workflows that may be comprised of dozens of processing and analytical steps. Furthermore, many workflows provide mechanisms for tracing provenance and methodologies that foster reproducible science. Despite their potential for enabling science, few studies have examined how the process of creating, executing, and sharing workflows can be improved. In order to promote open discourse and access to scientific methods as well as data, we analyzed a wide variety of workflow systems and publicly-available workflows on the public repository myExperiment. It is hoped that understanding the usage of workflows and developing a set of recommended best practices will lead to increased contribution of workflows to the public domain.},

  abstract     = {I argue that there may have been pressures inhibiting phonological change in Tocharian, particularly in relation to the centum/satem Indo-European split. Firstly, if the overall complexity of language strata may change over time (Sampson, 2009), syntactic, morphological, and lexical changes may have inhibited a change in the phonemic inventory of the language. Secondly, I examine the historical evidence for other languages in historical Central Asia in order to show that contact languages may have also horizontally influenced the centum nature of Tocharian. Thirdly, I posit that the merge of the PIE dorsal consonants may have been influenced by the decline in the general use, domain and range of Tocharian, which would be in line with recent research correlating small phonemic inventories with small language communities (Hay \& Bauer, 2007). Tocharian therefore may not have been susceptible to a weak dialect wave, or to a possible early branching of IE. This paper takes a new perspective on the history and development of Tocharian, and in turn on the nature of the ‘textbook’ isogloss example.}
