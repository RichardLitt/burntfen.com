  Abstract  = {Wellington Tree Wētā Hemideina crassidens are known to produce a stridulating sound during defense (Field 1982). No papers that I could find have presented publicly available audio files which include this sound. Here, I describe one such call, and encourage others to upload their observations to community science websites.}
