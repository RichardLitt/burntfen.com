  abstract      = {
    Wellington Tree W\={e}t\={a} Hemideina crassidens are known to produce a stridulating sound
    during defense (Field 1982). No papers that I could find have presented publicly available
    audio files which include this sound. Here, I describe one such call, and encourage others to
    upload their observations to community science websites.
