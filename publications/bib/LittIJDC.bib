    Scientific workflows are typically used to automate the processing, analysis and management of
    scientific data. Most scientific workflow programs provide a user-friendly graphical user
    interface that enables scientists to more easily create and visualize complex workflows that
    may be comprised of dozens of processing and analytical steps. Furthermore, many workflows
    provide mechanisms for tracing provenance and methodologies that foster reproducible science.
    Despite their potential for enabling science, few studies have examined how the process of
    creating, executing, and sharing workflows can be improved. In order to promote open discourse
    and access to scientific methods as well as data, we analyzed a wide variety of workflow
    systems and publicly available workflows on the public repository myExperiment. It is hoped
    that understanding the usage of workflows and developing a set of recommended best practices
    will lead to increased contribution of workflows to the public domain.
