Yesterday I gave a talk at the 2025 IEEE New Zealand Central Section Postgraduate Symposium, about the preprint which I and many other coathors published: [10 quick tips for making your software outlive your job](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06484). The talk was only five minutes, but it was fun to give. I regret that I was pretty sick with tonsillitis and was unable to stay for the whole conference, as it was a good showing and I enjoyed meeting some of the people there in the lunch break before the talk (I didn't unmask).

You can see the slides, [here](https://github.com/RichardLitt/talks/blob/master/IEEE%20Presentation_%2010%20quick%20tips%20for%20making%20your%20software%20outlive%20your%20job.pdf).

Still waiting to hear back on whether this paper will be published in PLOS...
