I don't use social media very much at the moment, or, in the least, not in any structured, coordinated way. But, when I do, I use these accounts:

- Instagram: [@richlittv3](https://www.instagram.com/richlittv3/)
- Mastodon: [mastodon.social/@richlitt](https://mastodon.social/@richlitt)
- Facebook: [richard.littauer](https://www.facebook.com/richard.littauer)
- LinkedIn: [Here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-littauer-130026138/)
- BlueSky: [@richlitt.bsky.social](https://staging.bsky.app/profile/richlitt.bsky.social)

I use various Slack, Discord, Element, and other chat programs, but I don't think it makes sense to share them here. I no longer use Twitter for anything, and I would encourage you to leave, too.

I also use various other platforms to record activities, often with others:

- eBird: [Profile](https://ebird.org/profile/Mjg0MTUx/world) - for birds
- iNaturalist: [Profile](https://www.inaturalist.org/people/richardlitt) - for life
- Peakbagger: [Profile](https://peakbagger.com/climber/climber.aspx?cid=31159) - for mountains

The best place to reach me is undoubtedly Signal or [email](mailto:richard@burntfen.com).
