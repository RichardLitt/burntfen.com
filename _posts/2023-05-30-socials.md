I don't use social media very much at the moment, or, in the least, not in any structured, coordinated way. But, when I do, I use these accounts:

- Twitter: [@richlitt](https://twitter.com/richlitt)
- Instagram: [@richlittv3](https://www.instagram.com/richlittv3/)
- Mastodon: [mastodon.social/@richlitt](https://mastodon.social/@richlitt)
- Facebook: [richard.littauer](https://www.facebook.com/richard.littauer)
- LinkedIn: [Here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/richard-littauer-130026138/)
- BlueSky: [@richlitt.bsky.social](https://staging.bsky.app/profile/richlitt.bsky.social)

I use various Slack, Discord, Element, and other chat programs, but I don't think it makes sense to share them here. 

The best place to reach me is undoubtedly Signal or [email](mailto:richard@burntfen.com).
