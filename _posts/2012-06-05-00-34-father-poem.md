> In 2012  
> My father put on weight.  
> "I'm 210!" He said,  
> sniffing like a seal,  
> mouth set in a clam outline.  
> He was always skinny,  
> A crazed, starved prophet.  
> (Arent't all prophets false?)  
> But now, an incipient week away,  
> He ate and swallowed and grew,  
> Until even his pants drew tight.  
> An old tree,  
> Growing through a white fence.  
> Eating and growing  
> "Yes. I'm 210 now. Yep."
