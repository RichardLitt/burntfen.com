Over a year ago (but not much over), a friend and I were sitting in one
of my favourite cafés at the time, Black Medicine, in Bruntsfield,
Edinburgh. We were talking about Twitter, and about what sort of posts
were allowed -- and what sort weren't. We began to wonder: what if we
had private twitter accounts, and no followers? What would the posts
be like?

A pact began to form. We both set up new accounts, and didn't tell the
other their names. We promised to never follow anyone; to never tweet at
anyone; to never retweet each other or anyone who might be able to
identify us; to not talk about it, except in generalities; to tweet when
we wanted, but never because we felt obligated to. At the end of the
year, we'd see who had more followers, and what the tweets looked like.

A year passed.

My friend, @simonv3 (his public account), won the contest, with four
followers. We have no idea why any of them followed him. I had no
followers - and frankly, I'm not surprised. 

No, I'm not going to give you the name of my account. This is largely because around 95% of my private tweets were swear words. Around 20% of them aren't fit for public consumption, and around 10% of them are midly socially incriminating. But in between the drunken rants and swears, there's a few very tender moments. Posts about how much I miss people; or home; or a girl. Posts that really show what exactly I was feeling at the time, and some that show how quickly a mood can change. Posts that speak of the heights and lows of last year (one of the most dynamic in my life, I suppose.) 

While I'm not going to post the twitter handle here; if you're a good
friend, and are brave enough to risk being told _Sorry, No_ to (I'm not giving it
out to everyone), feel free to ask for it. If you're curious as to what
_you_ might do - well, I suggest setting up your own account. I've
learned a lot - mainly, I've learned what social networks really mean,
and how the old adage of 'I tweet about my breakfast' only holds up when
you know others are listening.

For the record: there were no tweets about breakfast.
