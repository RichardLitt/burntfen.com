> Standing on my balcony  
> I begin to wring a poem  
> From the sunset.  
> 'Each year, I swallow summer whole  
> Gulp it down  
> And each autumn, I begin to choke'  
> No, that's no good, I say  
> It's not perfect  
> 'I swallow summer whole  
> And let it swill there,  
> Filling me in the winter
> And each spring,  
> I find I am hungry again'  
> No, not perfect.  
> While smoke wraps around my fingers  
> Like the suns last caresses  
> Six swallows fly overhead  
> And I begin to laugh.
