There's a relatively good song by Momus called Rhetoric, and in the
[Youtube video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mf4LLPMtSkU) there's this
lovely segment of an interview where he explains that art is great
because no one has to do it. It is so unnecessary. Sometimes, writing
these blogs feels that way.

Take this one. I opened it yesterday after having a back and forth of
around twenty twitter messages with a friend of mine in Edinburgh. She
had been castigated the police, calling them all bastards, and so on. I
tried to get across to her that the police - even the UK police, who are
about as close to V for Vendetta as possible while not letting people
catch on too much - do have some useful functions, that they are really
actually helpful in some cases, and that they're composed of human
beings who we should embrace as brothers and not alienate. Sure, I hate
the state and the popo, too. But that doesn't mean I am going to go
around calling all Police scum - they aren't, although their office
might be. I say this even though I've seen friends arrested, maligned,
marginilised, taken away in taxis, and submitted to almost every kind of
disgrace. But I still hold that we shouldn't demand for their
excommunication from life, or from any sort of new world order. 

At one point, my friend, who probably didn't get my messages intent as
much as I had hoped, partially due to Twitter, told me I didn't have the
right to tell her what to think or say. I responded with the sentiment
from one of my favourite quotes on the freedom of speech. [Philip Pullman](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HQ3VcbAfd4w)
states that "No one has the right to live without being schocked. No one
has the right to live without being offended." I do have the right to
suggest alternative ways of speaking, of telling her I don't think her
attitude towards our fellow-men-in-black is right. 

I still think that's pretty awesome.
