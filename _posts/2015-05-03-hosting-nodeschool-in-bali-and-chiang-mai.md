Recently, I co-organized the first NodeSchool event in Bali, and organized the first event in Chiang Mai. Here’s a write up of how they went.

### What is NodeSchool?

[NodeSchool](http://nodeschool.io/) is an open source community who build tutorials to help people learn how to use Node.js and javascript. NodeSchool chapters are groups of people in various cities who throw events where local coders come together to do the tutorials at once. It’s like a conference, but no one is talking, people are actually coding, and there’s a lot less pressure to be a good coder and much more pressure to hang out and have fun learning something new. 

I helped organize a NodeSchool in San Francisco in March, and mentored a workshop that was basically a one-off NodeSchool event as part of NodeSummit there. When I left San Francisco to go travel around South East Asia for a while, I figured I’d see if anyone was up for throwing some more NodeSchools where I was. 

### Bali

I looked at the [NodeSchool chapters](http://nodeschool.io/chapters.html), and no one had ever thrown any events in Bali before. In Bali, a website had been started by a guy called Eric, but there weren’t any specific plans or date. I messaged him on the GitHub repository for Bali, and we decided to have one.
