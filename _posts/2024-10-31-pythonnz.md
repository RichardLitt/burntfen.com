As of last night at the AGM, I am now a new Committee Member for [PythonNZ](https://python.nz). This is the local community group for the Python language and ecosystem, here in Aotearoa New Zealand. We hold meetups and host an annual event called KiwiPycon. While I don't use Python in everything, I do use it almost every day I am on a computer, and it is great to be able to support and be a member of a local tech community.

I gave a talk at the first KiwiPycon I attended, in 2024, on iNaturalist and eBird. You can watch it [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-KkQEzmOOBY&t=1s).
