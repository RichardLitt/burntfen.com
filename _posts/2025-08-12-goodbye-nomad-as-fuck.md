Nomad as Fuck is a project I ran, highlighting awesome nomads and talking about some of their stories. By nomads, I mean people with enough privilege to travel around the world and work remotely – somewhere between expats and tourists. This was the term I used ambiguously in the mid-2010s, pre-Covid and without a serious lens on what nomadism might entail.

The porject was born out of my desire to talk about all of the cool people I was meeting through Hacker Paradise, a remote coworker community I was a part of. Hacker Paradise changed me irrefutably; I learned a ton about different places, and made new and life-long friends. For all of the ills of remote work in third world countries, it was one of the first times in my life that I felt like I was experiencing abundance, instead of scarcity. Want to go climb that mountain then work? Sure! Want to travel to this country next week? Yeah! Want to see if you can put something on the front page of Hacker News? Why not.

I’ve been lucky and privileged enough to meet a lot of people, and to travel a lot, so Nomad As Fuck was my way of highlighting the ecosystem and talking about nomadism more. At the same time I ran it, I ran Antinomadic, which was the antithesis of this project – a series of letters between me and a friend about how hard it was to move all of the time. It didn't last as long. It wasn't as easy to write. It was more thoughtful.

Tomorrow, I am letting the domain nomadasfuck.com go. It's not important for me to keep renting the project. But, for reals, I've just matured as a person. I would never make Nomad As Fuck now. I find it a bit nauseating, a bit naïve, and a bit silly. But I'm glad I had fun when I was younger. I don't have regrets – just learning experiences. 

I’ve now archived it and am hosting it only on Netlify. You can see the archive, [here](https://nomadasfuck.netlify.app/).
