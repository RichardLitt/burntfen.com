My family   
has a bad   
habit of   
killing   
ourselves.  
  
My mother  
Slammed a smile onto her face  
For so many years that it locked itself  
I heard her say, once  
"I need to laugh that way  
at least once a year."  
She moved home, south  
where it's warm beneath the pine trees  
  
My sister  
broke down when she was cut off  
At a stop sign in a parking lot  
She tried so hard to shelve her childhood  
That she forgot it was still there  
dusting up and rusting away  
She has a child now  
And may dust those shelves in time  
  
My brother  
Drove the principal's car into a lake  
And got sent to juvenile  
For two long years  
He came back five inches taller  
With some white stubble  
And free entrance to the low security  
mental institution in the local hospital  
  
My father  
Drank and drank and drank  
All of the stars into his bones  
until they filled his marrow   
until he could walk on his reflection  
in the night ocean  
feet-bottoms touching  
  
And me  
I've written these stories  
Until the horizon squalls over  
And I remember  
And my father can't walk on water  
And my mother loved her dogs  
And my sister  
is bringing something useful into the world  
And I never had a brother  
But it sure kills me to pretend.
