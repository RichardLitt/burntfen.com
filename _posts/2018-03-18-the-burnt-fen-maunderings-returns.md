Today I did something I've been meaning to do for a long time. I drew some more entries in the style of the [Burnt Fen Maunderings](https://burntfen.com/comic), my old webcomic. These are a different me - older, somewhat more minimal, much less depressed but still overly reflective.

All of these are for sale. Let me know if you're interested.
