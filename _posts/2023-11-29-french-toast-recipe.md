This [sourdough pancake recipe](https://www.farmhouseonboone.com/our-favorite-sourdough-pancakes-recipe) is actually quite good. All you need is a well-fed sourdough starter, honey, salt, baking soda, and butter. Feed the sourdough starter the day before with King Arthur All-Purpose Flour, if you have that option. Flip them two-to-three minutes in. 

And then freeze the pancakes. When you're ready, defrost them the day before. Scramble an egg with some water - no need for milk. Add some cinnamon, but not too much. Dip the pancakes in the egg, and then fry it in the same cast-iron you used to cook bacon. Add maple syrup, again. 

I find that the tangier of the sourdough starter, the better the french toast.
