Here is my list of books I read last year, in order of when read. I love talking about books; if you've read any of these, [drop me a line](mailto:richard@burntfen.com) and let's chat!

* [The Left Hand of Darkness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Left_Hand_of_Darkness) by Ursula Le Guin.

* [Solaris](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solaris_(novel)) by Stanisław Lem.

* [Wake Up Before It Is Too Late: Trade and Environment Review 2013]() by the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development.
  - A very sobering read, especially as it is a few years old and, to my knowledge, things have only changed for the worst.
* [Colorless Tsukuru Tazaki and His Years of Pilgrimage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Colorless_Tsukuru_Tazaki_and_His_Years_of_Pilgrimage) by Haruki Murakami.
  - A strange book. Not as well done as his others, and with some unresolved narratives that I am not sure were better for it.
* [Orsinian Tales](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orsinian_Tales) by Ursula K. Le Guin.
  - These were beautiful, finely crafted short stories. Rarely for me, I read a few of them immediately after I finished them, to make sure that I got the more subtle details. The writing was absolutely exquisite.
* [The Name of the Wind](http://www.patrickrothfuss.com/content/books.asp) by Patrick Rothfuss.
  - This book is great. Lots of fun. Almost as good as _Mating Habits of the Common Draccus_.
* [The Wise Man's Fear](http://www.patrickrothfuss.com/content/books.asp) by Patrick Rothfuss.
  - Too short, at a little over 1000 pages. Where is Doors of Stone?
* [As Colours in a Rainbow: Poems and Songs by the Legend of Hornby Island](https://www.amazon.ca/As-Colours-Rainbow-Legend-Hornby/dp/B00DLZ1JJW) by Sammy Sammy
  - Easily the worst book I read this year.
