A new book review of mine was published the other week, in Linguist List. Here are the details:

* Richard Littauer (2013). _Review of F. Seifart, G. Haig, N. Himmelmann, D. Jung, A. Margetts, & P. Trilsbeek, eds., Potentials of Language Documentation: Methods, Analyses, and Utilization. In: Language Documentation & Conservation Special Publication No. 3. Online: University of Hawai'i Press._ In: _LINGUIST List_, 24.2604. [URL](http://linguistlist.org/pubs/reviews/get-review.cfm?SubID=12670360) 

It was a fun book to read, and it is also free. I suggest browsing through the LDCJ if you are interested in low resource languages.
