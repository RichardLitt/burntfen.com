I'm studying for my Foundations exam. I had some stray thoughts that
might be worth sharing, and that'll help me remember things.

  * _missed_ is a homophone to _mist_. I should write a poem about that.
    Why? Because mist is one of my favourite things, and staring into
it, a lot of things are arbitrarily called to the mind. Cf. TS Eliot's
poem 'Marina' for what I mean. 

  * I still think that morphology ought to be more important in language
    evolution. I wonder what lines of thinking would lead to if you
followed down the route that starts with the thought that morphology
sits at the interface of lexicon, phonology, and syntax - does that make
it a fossil itself? What is the nature of theoretical detritus - is it
more likely to be isolated or joined onto existing patterns?

  * I should use regular expressions more in NLP for Wired. For
    instance, in t = 'two minutes and five seconds', I should use
minutes and then split(' ') and then use t\[x-1\] to identify,
instead of currently saving slots 1 and 4 for retrieval. Just saying.
