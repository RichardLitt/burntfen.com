I decided that  
now was the  
time  
to write  
that  
poem.  
  
But  
the tea   
needed  
to be brewed.  
my bladder  
wouldn't empty itself.  
the sunset  
was drooping.  
  
And it was  
then  
that I found  
my little poem,  
about the way  
the hills looked,  
like Japan,  
detailed,  
and full of  
their own  
molded earth,  
  
my  
little  
poem,  
  
was...  
  
  
of what was I  
thinking   
again?  
  
and why is my  
tea  
cold?
