Last weekend I had the opportunity to go to the [Barcamp in Wroclaw](http://barcampwroclaw.org/).
A barcamp is an _un_-conference event, made more for audience
participation than for scheduled talks. This Barcamp was organised by
the [Unexus Team](http://www.unexus.org/team), which means that I had
the chance to hang out out with Justin Brown and Mark Bakacs, the two founders of Unexus, 
and also  with[Johan Johanssens](http://johan.janssens.me/), cofounder of [Joomla](http://www.joomla.org),
as well as the current founder of [Nooku](http://nooku.org/). Justin and
Mark were the ones who enabled me to come; I am now on baord as the new
front-end developer for Unexus, which means I will be helping to develop
the user experience for a social network website with a lot of
potential. I'll most likely be blogging more about that in the coming
months. I wasn't able to meet Mark's brother Pete, our designer, but I
am going to be working closely with him.  

The Barcamp itself lasted a day; there were around 30 people there, and
there were some pretty interesting talks. Most interesting, for me, was
Johan's talk about FOSS, [Free and Open Source Software](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software).
He started out with the tagline that _Open Source is
not like free beer_ - rather, _It's free as in Freedom._
Another good talk for me was Kamil Salamon's presentation of [TimeCamp](http://www.timecamp.com/),
a time-tracking productivity software that started in the past few years
and already has a good client base. I'm going to be working with Jamil
to integrate my own [Wired/Wyrd In](http://wyrdin.com) startup with his.
Mine is more focused on task organisation and planning, while his is
much more about screen-tracking, like RescueTime, and time-tracking.
Together, along with tools like [Trello](http://www.trello.com), we
should end up with a pretty solid product. Kamil gave me a ton of good
links to follow up, namely:  

 * www.timecamp.com/auth/register  
 * www.visikid.com  
 * www.timeandtracking.com  
 * www.jerela.com  
 * [Todo.txt](http://todotxt.com/)  
 * [LetsFreckle](http://letsfreckle.com/)  

Johan also gave some good discussion of licensing models, something I've
been struggling with researching recently. Importantly, it seems that the
license of a software only becomes applicable when you distribute
the software. That only happens when the software goes from a copyright
holder to a non-copyright holder. In essence, Github is distribution. I
am going to have to move Wyrd In off of Github, soon, then - I'll
probably set up a git repo on my own server to deal with it.  

And that was the weekend, in a nutshell. When I got back, I had a ton of
fresh ideas, a good perspective on what I am doing with Unexus, and a
cold. That's alright though; it was worth it.
