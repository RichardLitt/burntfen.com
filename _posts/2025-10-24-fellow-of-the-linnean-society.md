On October 16th, I was voted in as a Fellow of the [Linnean Society](https://www.linnean.org).

The Linnean Society was founded in 1788, and is the oldest learned society devoted to the science of natural history. It continues to provide access to collections, to host a variety of journals, and to provide services to its members. Why join, though?

Most days, I wake up and have to reform myself. I use some tricks to do this - journalling, routines, laying out goals for the day the night before. Some signals in my environment obviously tell me who and what I am - the house that I live in, my partner, the food in my kitchen, the language I speak. Other signals are less strong but still evident daily: my body tells me it needs to exercise, my emails and calendar remind me that I am a PhD student at a university, my bank account and obligations remind me that I am the type of person who does the work I need to do.

If I woke up tomorrow in a newer world, with no ties to the past, no English, no clothes, I do not doubt that I would act differently and that I would be a different person. We are the fictions and truths that we build up. I'm fond of saying that I remain on earth because of my friends and family (and possibly also myself as a friend, too). Without connections, what worth would there be in living?

Joining this learned Society is another way for me to signal who I am, to myself, and to others. Hey everyone: I work in the field of natural history, I am a dedicated evangelist for science, I value sharing and communication and ethics in what I do.

To be a fellow, one needs to apply and then be voted into the society by the Fellowship Committee. I am happy that they approved of my application, which I sent in with referential help from my advisor Kris Bubendorfer and my mentor from the Royal Society Te Apārangi, [Neil Birrell](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/n-birrell). It feels good to feel welcome (and no, I don't know the acceptance rates).

Really: I am incredibly grateful to the society for approving my application. I didn't expect that. I'm grateful to those who've helped me get to the point where this is possible, too. Not just people who've listened to me natter on about nomenclature for the last year, although they are certainly the most patient.

One of the fun things about being a member is that I get to use the [post-nominals](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Post-nominal_letters) 'FLS'. I'm also a member of the Royal Society Te Apārangi (although not a fellow), which means that my full title is properly Richard Littauer MA (Hons) MSc FLS MRSNZ. Which is pretty wordy, to be honest.

I have a few qualms about this process. Am I being elitist by joining a learned society? I'm unsure. I'm far more privileged than most - but does application and inclusion itself lend itself to elitism? Another one - how are the funds of the society disbursed, and is it worth the annual fee? I don't know yet. Is there ever a proper place to say, "Richard Littauer FLS"? I guess my CV. Otherwise, no idea. If you have thoughts on any of these, or other questions, I'd love to hear them.

But for now, I join a society with a rich history, whose fellows included Darwin, Huxley, Franklin, Attenborough, [Turner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emma_Louisa_Turner), and others. I'm glad to be part of that number.
