The programme I am currently on is inviting applications for the coming year. If you know of anyone who might be interested, take a look! Alternatively, there are a load of [other Erasmus Mundus Masters](http://www.em-a.eu/en/erasmus-mundus/erasmus-mundus-master-courses.html) available. From what I've heard, they're all great. Mine is.

####The EMMLCT Program in Brief

The EMMLCT program is an international distributed Master of Science course. It provides students with profound knowledge and insight into the various disciplines that contribute to the methods of language and communication technologies (also known as computational linguistics or natural language processing) and it strengthens their ability to work according to scientific methods. Moreover, the students acquire practice-oriented knowledge by choosing appropriate combinations of modules in Language Technology, Computational and Theoretical Linguistics, and Computer Science. The course is designed to meet the demands of industry and research in a rapidly growing area and offers education and training opportunities for the next generations of leaders in research and innovation.  

The program involves studying one year each at two different Universities of the consortium. After completing all study requirements the students obtain two already approved Master of Science/Arts degrees with legal value in the countries of issue.  

The course consists of compulsory core modules, as well as elective advanced modules in Language Technology and Computer Science, optionally complemented by a project, and completed by a Master Thesis.  

The EMMLCT program is approved and supported by the Erasmus Mundus Program of the European Union.
