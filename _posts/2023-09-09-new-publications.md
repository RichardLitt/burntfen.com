I have added a few items to my [publications list](https://www.burntfen.com/projects/publications/) recently, and I wanted to add them here, too. None of them are peer-reviewed publications, but I thought each merited note there as they represent current work.

### Book Contributions

I have contributed to these publications, and am listed as a contributor:

* National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine. (2021). <a href="https://nap.nationalacademies.org/catalog/26308/developing-a-toolkit-for-fostering-open-science-practices-proceedings-of">Developing a toolkit for fostering open science practices: Proceedings of a workshop.</a>

The [NAS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Academies_of_Sciences,_Engineering,_and_Medicine) is a congressionally chartered organization that serves as the collective scientific national academy of the United States, according to Wikipedia. I am thrilled that I was able to collaborate on one of their publications, as it may have an influence on future policy regarding open source software.

### Facilitation

Recently, I also facilitated a panel at an ACM conference on open source.

* Moderator of a Panel on the role of Open Source in Open Science, June 27-29, 2023 at the <a href="https://acm-rep.github.io/2023/">2023 ACM Conference on Reproducibility and Replicability</a>.

This panel was on reproducibility at CROSS, the Center for Research in Open Source Software at UC Santa Cruz, who have been long-time collaborators with me in OSPO++ and elsewhere. The [ACM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Association_for_Computing_Machinery) is the world's largest scientific and educational computing society - and to have even a small role in it was excellent.

### Poster

Last August I presented a poster at AFO, the Association of Field Ornithologists. This is a different field entirely than open source, but birds are something I care passionately about, and I was excited to dip my toes into the water of ornithological research. While working on a list of subspecies of birds in the Northeast for a book I am slowly working on, I found a term in the literature that I thought could be updated, as our language has changed since the 60s and it is now considered racist. Short of making a full paper, I figured a poster was also citable by others and can be used to update the term in the wider literature.

* Littauer, Richard (2022). <a href="https://www.burntfen.com/publications/LittauerAFOBewicks.pdf">A Proposal for Renaming Bill Types of Bewick's Swans</a>. Poster presented at the Centennial Meeting of the Association of Field Ornithologists, Plymouth, MA, October 11, 2022. [bib](https://www.burntfen.com/publications/bib/LittauerAFOBewicks.bib)

I have some more publications in the works, of course, but these are just three things that I have done recently that I thought were of note.
