I recieved a book in the mail today, called [Code {Poems}](http://code-poems.com/book.html). 
It is the 54th copy out of 100 copies printed in the first edition. 
On page 18, the following is written:  

    IMPORT SOUL  

    # This script should save lives  

    import soul  

    for days in len(life):  
      print happiness  

At the bottom of the page is my name, and beneath it, `// Python`, 
the language the poem is written in This marks the first time that I've
seen my name in print in a book or a journal of poetry that wasn't
connected to my educational establishment - in short, today is the first
day I am officially a published poet.
