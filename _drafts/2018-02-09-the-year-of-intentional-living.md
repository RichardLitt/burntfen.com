Decisions are difficult. Each decision is an investment: I am going to put in this amount of time to phrase what I want to change, and I am going to put in this other amount of time to judge the best options, and I am going to put in some more effort here to make sure that what I am doing is actually in line with what I want. And then, of course, there is the follow through. 

It is easy to make ill-informed decisions, particularly on matters that touch the self. Take a common example: “I am going to quit drinking,” we say each morning we have a hangover - because we can’t imagine what actions would need to be taken for that to be true, and how we are to intentionally set out to make those actions easy. We don’t think - this means I can’t have beers on the beach on my next vacation. This means I won’t take communion at church. This means I won’t have a glass of wine on Christmas. This means I won’t go out with my friends on Saturday. This means I may lose those friends, who are going to go out without me. Saying, “I am going to quit drinking” is easy, if you ignore the hard work of figuring out what you’ll have to change.   
  
It is often hard to know if a decision is ill-formed until after you have made it, and after you have taken action. Only after making a decision are you able to judge your process, and how it sits with you. There is an old game I used to play, when faced with binary decisions. I would flip a coin, and if I wasn’t satisfied with the result, I’d go with the other one. The coin-flipping wasn’t as important as the gut feeling afterwards, which you could use to judge the strength of the resolve. _Do I want to go see a movie? Heads. Oh, it says I shouldn’t go. That makes me sad. I’m going to go anyway._   
  
This method doesn’t work with larger decisions. It ignores the fact that your gut may not always be right. It sidesteps the emotional effort that needs to be done when neither decision is good. It forces you to think in terms of yes or no, this or that. In some cases it is useful - but what do you do in the other cases? How do you know that you’ve made a good decision?   
  
Decision making is one of the hardest skills to learn. We’re not taught it at school. From a young age, we’re taught to do this, and to do that, without asking why, because that’s what needs to be done. Clean your room. Go to school. Obey your parents. Pass your tests. Get straight As. Study. Get a job. Choose a hobby. Invest your time. I could go on. What we’re not taught is to figure out why to do these things. For example, clean your room. As an order, it’s inane and a task. But as a decision, you can weigh the costs and benefits. Why clean? Because it’s an act that will make you feel more adequate, because it will be easier to find things, because constant cleaning is easier than once a month, because that makes it harder for mice to spread pathogens, because it makes it easier to win arguments later with your parents, because you’ll want to hang out there more than in an empty room. A dirty room is entropic, catastrophic, and precludes the benefits listed above. Put this way, the decision to clean your room and keep it clean is the clear option, going forward.   
  
How many rote paths have you followed, because you haven’t put in the effort to decide on the best option, like this?  
  
This is a question I’ve been asking myself, recently. There are some obvious decisions I’ve put off or failed to adequately prepare for. I should have thought about the downstream effects of letting my thesis drag on for years. I should have considered  the amount of effort it would take to keep The User Is Drunk going, and decided whether or not I wanted to do it. I should have invested $500 in Ethereum when it came out, because I knew it was going to go higher. I should have thought about the carbon cost of going paleo, the risk to my limbs of starting running, the opportunity cost of deciding not to look for jobs. The list goes on.   
  
But I am ill-equipped, still, to make adequate decisions. I haven’t taken a course on decision making. I don’t know the literature. And I haven’t tried to intentionally plan, execute, and reflect on dozens of decisions with a mindset of improving my process.   
  
So, that’s what I hope to do in this decision journal. 

The plan: Make 365 decisions. One a day, over the course of a year.

The goal:
- Get much better at decision making.
- Live intentionally. Know what I am doing, and why.
- Act on desires that I’ve put off, find demons I’ve been avoiding, and resolve to be proactive in the future.
- Share my process with others. To let others come along for the journey.

A secondary goal would be to build up a social media following around intentional living and improving thought processes, and to get financial compensation to offset the time spent on this excursion. One of my mottos is that if you can do something for yourself, find a way to get others to pay for you to do it, and find a way to leverage it to make the next steps easier.
