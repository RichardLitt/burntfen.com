Some birds seen in Vermont may not have a subspecies level; some cannot safely be identified as a specific subspecies; some can only be safely identified in hand; and some are the nominate subspecies, but not commonly reported as a subspecies, particularly on eBird.

Here, I'm trying to list what I know about subspecies identification. I hope to grow this, in time. If you have comments, please email <a href="mailto:richard@burntfen.com">richard@burntfen.com</a> and I'd love to chat to you about this!

For the most part, I am interested in birds which can be logged on [eBird](https://ebird.org) using a subspecies identification. However, there are cases where eBird doesn't have that option, due to difficulties in the field. I hope to tease those out here, too.

### Example Checklist

- X Northern Cardinal: _Heard, seen._
- X **Northern Cardinal (Common)**: _Male: Breast brighter red than crest. Female: Black face mask, neither grey nor white._
- X **Red-eyed/Philadelphia Vireo**: _Unable to visually identify._
- X Philadelphia Vireo: _Unable to visually identify, but song clearly higher and slower than REVI._
- X Philadelphia Vireo: _Visually identified._
- X Red-eyed Vireo: _Visually identified._
- X Rock Pigeon (Feral Pigeon): _No comment._
- X American Crow: _No comment._
- X House Sparrow: _No comment._
- X Northern Flicker: _Heard._
- X **Northern Flicker (Yellow-shafted)**: _Identified by yellow feathers. Cheeks and throat tan, contrasting with gray crown and nape; on the male, malar black and nape crescent red._
- X Least Bittern: _No comment. Visually identifiable as I. e. exilis given ocherous side of head, creamy yellow wing coverts, but not an option on eBird._

### Subspecies that can only be identified with visual confirmation

- Northern Cardinal (Common)
- Northern Flicker (Yellow-shafted)
- Least Bittern _I. e. exilis_ _Not an option on eBird_.

### Species that should not be safely identified without visual confirmation

- Red-eyed/Philadelphia Vireo
- Gray-cheeked/Bicknell's Thrush _In migration using NFCs_.

### Open questions to research

- Do Yellow-shafted and Red-shafted Northern Flickers sound diagnostically different?
- Can spectral analysis identify a PHVI from a REVI?
