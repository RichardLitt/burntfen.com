I bought this book at [Drawn and Quarterly](https://www.drawnandquarterly.com/), my favourite local bookstore, because it was in the used bin at a discount and I've been looking for more great essays ever since devouring _Known and Strange Things_ by Teju Cole. I'm still not convinced picking up _An Arrangement of Skin_ was a good move.

On the first page, I wrote my first margin note: "Sad people being sad." Unfortunately, that theme continued throughout the book. My final comment was this:

> Thank God it's finally over. I had to force myself through this book, at gunpoint. Her quirky stories and ridiculous verbosity quickly became dull and ponderous. Too many question marks, not enough content. I got very tired of all the affairs. Who cares!

> Now, on with my life!

I'm unhappy with a review that focuses on negatives, because, for literary fiction like this, that's more a sign of my own inability to see the good parts than it is on the writer. So, before consigning this book to the shelf, there's a few things that could be said for it in praise.

First, not all of the essays were ponderous or poorly written. One, _Bluebeard's Closet_, about her grandfather being a closet homosexual, was especially well done. Some of the sentences were arresting in their composition. _The Goliath Jazz_, about a brother from her school murdering his sister, was also well done. When Anna talks about events which are less related to her, she talks crisply. _Strange Merchants_, where she ties together anonymous writing to someone in notes on her desk, her father, World War II, and Germans hiding in South America, was also well done. _The Guiniveres_, about her mother singing in a folk band in the fifties, was also well done, although I didn't connect to it as much (I wonder, now, if I am including it because I feel self-conscious at pointing at three stories about men, in a book by a woman.)

When Anna touches on her own experiences, I found the book much more forced. She writes about going to taxidermy classes, and I can't help thinking that she's doing this so that she can write about it. It reeks of self indulgence, to me. This, combined with the many times she mentions cheating on her husband, her affair, and her old mentor Lee yelling at her, left a bad taste in my mouth. I felt that many of the essays were her trying to sculpt her own personal pain into something work keeping. That's fine, but I didn't feel connection, at all, and by the end, I didn't think she succeeded.

At one point, I wrote in the margins:

> Is all art, in some way, forced? We have the make up reasons to make art.

Momus said something similar in an interview once: "No one has to make art." I understand her predicament, her trying hard to turn her life into something worth writing about, and trying to turn her writing into something worth reading. A master, however, wouldn't make it so clear. There was so little illusion.

This was very much a first collection - something it is easy for me to say, as someone who has never published my own essays in a book. The book is guilty of the crime of being rough. And, ultimately, that's forgivable.
