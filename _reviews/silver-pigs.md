I'm not sure where I found this book, except on my shelves, but it was an excellent, fun read. I mostly read it before bed, but found myself going to sleep earlier so I could read it later. Incredibly well researched, the plot follows Marcus Didius Falco, a private detective or informant, as he tries to track down a conspiracy involving silver pigs, or lead ingots, which were going to be used to fund a push for the empery. The conceit was somewhat silly - a private detective in Rome? - but it also was probably true in some sense, as there's always an underbelly for every city, and there certainly was one there. Poor Didius is dragged halfway across the empire to Britain - at one point, he ends up voluntarily working in a lead mine there for three months and almost dying as a result - and finally uncovers the plot and wins the approval of the emperor, as well as a minor fortune of 400 sesterces, which he rejects in a fit of moral pique. A rollicking read. 

Of course, you can't have a mystery story without some good sex and blood. The sex was somewhat lacking for most of the book, until one memorable lacuna where "that was between me, the senator's daughter, and the gardener's horse," which I loved. Helena is a good femme fatale, and I thoroughly enjoyed the witty spats between her and Didius. The blood was the normal sort - people do get banged up a lot, don't they. 

I loved this book. I'll have to get the rest of the series.
