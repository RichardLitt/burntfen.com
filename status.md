I am currently working on:

<div class="current-project">
<h1>My Masters' Thesis</h1>

<p>
<a href="https://github.com/RichardLitt/thesis">ðŸ”—</a>
</p>
</div>

This is titled _Open Source Code and Low Resource Languages_, for my MSc in Computational Linguistics at the Saarland University in Germany. Follow along on that repository.


### Why does this page exist?

I only have a limited amount of time - not only in my day to day life, but also on this planet. Past experience has shown me that I canâ€™t afford to have my time split between too many projects. Instead, I need to choose a single project, and make that what I am doing, at the expense of all of the others.

If I donâ€™t guard my time zealously, I find that it is sapped between ten thousand different things, and I canâ€™t focus on anything. This page - a public statement on what I am working on - is my response to this threat. 

This is kind of like an autoresponder, but I wanted to have more information than just one line.

### Where can I keep updated on your status?

Right here. Iâ€™ll send out a weekly email with updates, too. Follow along at [http://tinyletter.com/richlitt](http://tinyletter.com/richlitt).

Or hit me up on Twitter [@richlitt](https://twitter.com/richlitt). I check it during my office hours, normally.

### When do you work on this project?

I am working on this project every day, normally until 13:00 at my local time zone (normally EST). All other projects are slated for my office hours between 14:00 and 17:00.

### When do you do other stuff?

14:00-17:00. I just said that.

### So you donâ€™t want to do X anymore?

Not necessarily. I may have some small time for it. Iâ€™ve set aside a couple of hours each day to get to other projects and to concerns like yours. 

### When will you get to X?

I donâ€™t know. I havenâ€™t decided on whether or not Iâ€™ll make a schedule public, as a schedule implies that Iâ€™ll get to something later. Iâ€™m not interested in whatâ€™s after this - Iâ€™m only interesting in the task in front of me.

### I really need your feedback, now.

If you want an answer to something immediately, send me an email with the word `dragon` in the title. No reason this canâ€™t be fun.

### Iâ€™m your client.

Oh. I **should** have flagged your email for my work hours. Please let me know as soon as possible if Iâ€™ve missed something. Keyword for your email: `coins`.

### I want to help with one of your projects!

Thatâ€™s awesome! Get in touch immediately! Maybe include the word `griffin` in the title of your email?

### Can I sponsor your projects? You do cool stuff.

Absolutely. [Here is my Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/richlitt). Let me know if you want to help another way - Iâ€™m all ears. Keyword for your email: `loot`. 

### This is an incredibly pretentious autoresponder, and I find you pretentious, too.

Thatâ€™s OK. I hope you find happiness today, however you can!

Do you have a better idea for how I can do this? Get in touch. Keyword: `troll`.
