<p>Here is a listing of all of the blog posts I currently have hosted on this site. I have in the past used other blogs - many of them. However, to make things simpler for everyone, I'm defaulting down to this blog for now, for all new posts. This blog is not a simple, cut-and-dry, one-topic journal. It was never meant to be.</p>
<p>Any <a href="https://tinyletter.com/richlitt/">interesting pieces</a> will be mentioned in <a href="https://tinyletter.com/richlitt/">my newsletter</a>, normally posted on some Fridays.</p>
<p>Any <a href="https://tinyletter.com/practice/">daily pieces</</a> will be cross-posted on <a href="https://tinyletter.com/practice/">my daily practice newsletter</a>.</p>
<p>You can see posts arranged by tags <a href="{{ BASE_PATH }}/tags">here</a>. Here is <a href="https://www.burntfen.com/feed.xml">the RSS Feed</a>.</p>
