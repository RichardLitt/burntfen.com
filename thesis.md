I am a PhD student at Te Herenga Waka Victoria University of Wellington. I'll try to keep this page updated with more information.

### Thesis Title:

*Building Tools for Community Science Datasets to Model Bird Populations and Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza in Aotearoa New Zealand*

### Supervisors

Kris Bubendorfer, Markus Lukzac-Roesch

### Proposal Abstract

Community science platforms have enabled the creation of global observational datasets which afford unprecedented insights into natural biodiversity.
The heterogeneous nature of the data presents significant challenges for standardisation, quality assurance, quality control, and workflow management. The goal of my research is to build tools that enable researchers to use these datasets with higher degrees of certainty, to develop workflows to allow for standardised, reproducible processing of the data, and to use case studies that offer meaning- ful insights into how community science can be used to understand epidemiol- ogy and population demographics, in order to inform public policy. I focus, in particular, on bird populations in Aoteaora New Zealand and Oceania, and on predicting the oncoming significant threat posed by Highly Pathogenic Avian Influenza (HPAI).
