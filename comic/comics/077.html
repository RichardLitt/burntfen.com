<p>...I've often wondered if I'd be happier if I lowered my standards, dated a girl for a bit, and saw if climbing the ladder would actually work. Luckily, I'm not that much of a dick. Perhaps sadly. <br />PS. When I wrote this first, I wrote "[snip] and see if climbing the latter would actually work." That shows some really interesting things: first, some basic tense agreement mistakes when further away from the independent clause: "see" should be "saw", there. Secondly, that I am definitely American, as [latter] and [ladder] are pronounced identically by American speakers, who use a tap or flap instead of [t] and [d].<br />
PPS. Does this make me sad, or a linguist?...</p>
