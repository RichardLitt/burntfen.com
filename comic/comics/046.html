<p><strong>The First Comic</strong></p>

<p> ----- </p>
<p>...This was the first comic, done in probably around January, 2008, not including some I did in highschool. I rather like it, Noam Chomsky being an oil diver and all. I also like the doodles. I re-hashed one of the jokes in the next comic. 'Cham cup' comes from an awesome part of the English Language, where the 'ch' from 'ich' didn't go away as soon as we thought, and you got 'I'm' represented as 'cham' for centuries after 'ich' for 'I' had died away. I've seen it in King Lear...</p>
