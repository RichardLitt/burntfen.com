<p>...I've been meaning to put this somewhere for at least two years. I wrote this in my journal from the '06 summer in Galway: &quot;I sat next to Poseidon on the bus to the ferry. He wore jeans and a collared long-sleeve t-shirt. The wide, indomitable sea.&quot; Seen him a few times since. Possibly the best description I've seen for carrying around a baby animal is in the movie Waterloo - a soldier plunders, and when asked what he was doing with a pig (plundering is a capital offense), he goes on to explain it was lost and that he was trying to find it's family. The officer in charge: &quot;This man knows how to make something out of a desperate situation. Promote him to corporal.&quot;...</p>
