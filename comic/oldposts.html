<p align="justify">Here's another drawing I technically stole, but will give back to my friend, by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frank_Quitely">Frank Quitely</a>. I got no words. <br /> <hr /> <br /> And so I must announce that I think I am going to be going on hiatus again. I am going to NY for the next two months, and won't be near a scanner. I may do more picture - window comics, I like those, but don't expect many drawings. Also, seeing as how XKCD has just stolen my favourite comic's line, well, I'm beginning to think that I hit my stride around a year ago. Thanks guys, it's been fun. This page will stick around and all, don't worry. I might even have more prose coming at some time. </p>
<p class="justify">-----</p>
<p align="justify">I think that I am, in fact, going hiking tomorrow. I will be posting all of my backlog and some guest comics, while I'm gone - but as I don't have that automated, I'm just going to throw it all on here. Sound cool? If I don't come back, tell someone that I went hitching up to Ft. William, and planned to travel from there across the Cape Wrath Trail to Ullapool. </p>
<p class="justify">-----</p>
<p align="justify">Maybe I should offer prizes to people if they comment. Ok, yeah. If you comment, I will officially draw you a comic of some sort on some topic. Or something. How does that sound? The above is a guest comic, by Chaz. I can't remember if I've put it up before or not, but here it is. Hooray for a small but indomitable fan base! Drop in for another comic tomorrow. I also put some more stuff up in the <a href="http://www.burntfen.net/prose/index.html">Prose</a> page. Feel free to check it out. And I think that's all for me, today. </p>
<p class="justify">-----</p>
<p align="justify">In keeping with being productive and having nothing to do, I will have five updates this week, as well. Why not? So check in tomorrow and the next day. Of course, I am also going hiking this week, most likely, which means I won't be updating. But that's so far into the future that I can't conceive of being away from my computer. I'll put links up if I do go. As for this weekend, golly, I had a good time. My wallet is being seriously attacked, though. So I am going to chill out for a bit. Right.</p>
<p class="justify">-----</p>
<p align="justify">Today I forgot to upload earlier, but no bother. I've put the comment thing beneath this - might do a remodel of the site, make it look less like just a blank page with centred stuff. Today I finished Peace by Gene Wolfe, again, a great book, and I really highly suggest it to anyone who wants an insidiously pleasant piece of Americana. Not much else happened today - a friend did give me new pots for my plants, though. That's always good. </p>
<p class="justify">-----</p>
<p align="justify">Yesterday I managed to do a considerable amount of work, surprisingly. Much of it was on some linguistics stuff, but a lot of it was on <a href="/sam/index.php" />my sister's wedding's website,</a> proving, somehow, that I do actually know a bit about websites. Alas that I don't know more. Anyway, time to get out of bed. I'm hungry. Oh! note that I put my twitter in below. Feel like I should stay more connected to you all. Or something. </p>
<p class="justify">-----</p>
<p align="justify">Yesterday passed in around 3,000 blinks of an eye. My typewriter is dead, my smokes are smoked, and one of my good friends has gone to Pakistan for the summer. If the sun doesn't come back soon I'm likely to have gone fetal in my bed for the rest of the summer. </p>
<p class="justify">-----</p>
<p align="justify">Keeping up with the one-comic-per-day this week, to celebrate now being over 100, here is the comic for today. Again, not drawn with pen (entirely), and, again, not very good. See you all tomorrow. (If, indeed, anyone checks this thing.)</p>
<p class="justify">-----</p>
<P align="justify">Comic number 100. I've officially done this for ages. (Perhaps too long, he thinks to himself.) To celebrate, I'll be updating a comic every day this week, unless I forget, as I often do. Might be best to check back late at night, or the day after, as usual. I drew these with a paint brush, because I'm cool like that, on the meadows. Good times. I've finished Californication, I've drunk all of my whiskey, I've smoked all of my cigarettes, and now the only job for the summer is to stare at the wall, do niggling nothings, and pray that sooner or later I'll be able to rest my head in peace under some tombstone. My pillow just isn't heavy enough. -June 7, Richard</P>
<p class="justify">-----</p>
<p align="justify">It is so sunny out. And yesterday I managed to write two pages of something, as well as work for a few hours on this linguistics thing Dave Arnold and I are doing. And somehow, I haven't got a hangover or a cough from the smoke and bad whiskey. Ah...summer!</p>
<p class="justify">-----</p>
<p align="justify">Comic of today. Not much to say. Hooray? (If people actually want, I could actually write stuff here. But I'm pretty sure a blog doesn't really please anyone. Also, ya'll should totally RSS this thing, because, let's face it, I'm not the best at updating.)</p>
<p class="justify">-----</p>
<p align="justify">Right. Here's today's comic. I had a fantastic weekend. Mostly because I discovered Californication. Also, because I appear to have thrown out my neck. I didn't know I could do that. That's all. </p>
<p class="justify">-----</p>
<p align="justify">So...my keyboard died. I had wonderful three days reading Lord of the Rings for the first time in years. Man, what an awesome book. So cool. And here's a comic. Also - I am going back to the US for the summer. Huzzah? Visa issues for the wynn.</p>
<p class="justify">-----</p>
<p align="justify">Hey everyones. So, today, instead of putting up a comic, I'm going to putting up the link to an album I've found stacked behind some scrolls in the library of Minas Tirith. By which I mean an album that a friend and someone who isn't me but actually is (we're trying not to take credit for it) sat around and recorded yesterday. Since mediafire didn't work, I've put it here. But have fun downloading.</p>
<p class="justify">-----</p>
<p align="justify">This was poorly executed. But it's 2am, <a href=www.burntfen.net/sam/index.php>Sam's website</a> is slow, I spent most of the day coming up with a linguistics theory, and I've had only around 5 cups of tea. I think it's time to call it a week. See ya'll on Monday. </p>
<p class="justify">-----</p>
<p align="justify">Hey Guys. I suck at updating. Serious. Seriously, though, I mean, for serious. Sorry. I am going to be putting up <b>One comic per day!</b> this week. Enjoy. More updates later. Awesome. Enjoy the above. </p>
<p class="justify">-----</p>
<p align="justify">So, I've been late. I'm sorry guys. But now my essays are over! I spent most of yesterday drunk, actually, in some sort of celebration. Tonight I am going to go see Iron Man 2. Besides that, I'm trying to stay busy. This is my list of things to do. So much to do. I'm glad to be done with the essays, and I'm glad to crack on with these projects. I worked on one a fair amount today: <a href="http://www.burntfen.net/sam/index.php">Sam and Carrie's site</a>. Also, been on the radio a lot, recently. Here's a link to one of the interviews: <a href="http://www.burntfen.net/folderofstuff/perth.mp3">6pr about Na'vi</a>. And that's all for now, guys. Will try to update semi-regularly from now on. As you can see, I have a lot on my plate. But I have a new rose bush and ivy, so, really, everything should be fine. </p>
<p class="justify">-----</p>
<p align="justify">Still down in the essay dumps. I hope one day it burns and the black smoke carries me far away...or something that the Mountain Goats sang, anyway. Since I feel bad not putting anything up, here's a desktop I made as a motivation tool yesterday. As you can tell, I am a very efficient procrastinator. The doubled pictures are because I was too lazy to crop and wanted it to be centered. </p>
<p align="justify">-----</p>
<p align="justify">So, sorry about Friday. I had an essay due thursday, and I have one due monday. I don't think I've ever really felt like I don't have time to update. So, yeah, apologies. Here is a thing I drew around a year ago. Some of it is still true. It's my way of saying: " Oh SHIT I HAVE AN ESSAY DUE on MONDAY and I haven't done nearly enough crap crap crap god I love agreement morphology"...or something. See you all on Wednesday. </p>
<p align="justify">-----</p>
<p align="justify">Let's see. Writing an essay. Not much else going on. Changed some of the site, a bit: most notably, the <a href="linguistics/index.html">Linguistics</a> page. Lots of good stuff in there. Continue pawning the Meadows maps to your friends, guys. The xx has the most amazing album ever. And Evolang was apparently great, according to Dave. Right. Nothing more to say. Except: still selling the <a href=https://www.burntfen.com/comic/merch/pretfrr.png>French pretentious</a> shirt. Let me know before Friday at richfenne at gmail.com what size and colour you want: they will cost 7.50GBP plus shipping. </p>
<p align="justify">-----</p>
<p align="justify">Well, I had another one planned for today, but the scanners are down in the library, and I was too busy coughcoughnappigncough yesterday to scan it. Since this is basically a comic anyway, expect the new one on Monday. I've done a lot of work for E.P.I.C., as well as my essays (in case my lecturer's read this, in which case I hope they give me extensions as I obviously am deeply unstable (that's a joke)). I also read Bone from a Dry Sea, a pretty crap young adult novel about the aquatic ape theory. Going to copy it's style for my book. Today, I have a surfer coming over, and I am getting interviewed by Fox for The Sun about being Britain's number 1 Avatar fan, apparently. Awesome? No. Getting paid 50 quid to translate God Save the Queen into na'vi? Definitely awesome. </p>
<p align="justify">-----</p>
<p align="justify">Yesterday I worked. I know! Weird, right? Also, LCD Soundsystem's album was leaked. It's amazing. So was Broken Social Scene's album. Equally amazing. And Veckatimest by Grizzly Bear lossless is better. Also on that note, I downloaded the High Places eponymous album, and <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=laA1s0nJtg8&feature=related">the ending track</a> is still the best thing ever. That's it, for today. </p>
<p align="justify">-----</p>
<p align="justify">I'm sorry for the delays, recently, but I am quite busy with life. However, a lot of things have been happing on the web. First off, Native American languages, as above, are awesome. And I am now part of <a href="www.saivus.org">S.A.I.V.U.S.</a>, the Society for the Advancement of Indigenous Vernaculars of the United States. I'll be compiling beginners material for some languages this summer, although I'm not sure which yet. Should be fun. I'm even on their staff page, now. Second, I've set up my own website project: <a href="http://www.tardis.ed.ac.uk/~rich">E.P.I.C.</a>, the Epic Poetry Internet Collection. What I hope to make of it is a massive database of all epic poetry, from across the world. This hasn't been done before, and, most cooly, I'm going to be using the code from <a href="www.perseus.tufts.edu">Perseus</a> to allow linguistic ananysation and stats to be run upon the poems. Please let me know if you're interested in helping out! Also, I've gotten back into contact with <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chris_Knight_%28anthropologist%29">Prof. Knight</a>, and I'm looking forward to working with his guidance on a novelisation of his book <a href="http://books.google.co.uk/books?id=TECGMrey5UEC&printsec=frontcover&dq=blood+relations&source=bl&ots=qfJWSecou0&sig=Y_Kg3QV1Wrh30TiYSfj0H_m7jKc&hl=en&ei=s-7CS4CUJ4zGngOki7XZBg&sa=X&oi=book_result&ct=result&resnum=6&ved=0CCwQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&q&f=false">Blood Relations</a>. And that's about it. I have another comic coming on Wednesday.</p>
<p align="justify">-----</p>
<p align="justify">Here is Dean's bit of my website, with a whole bunch of awesome comics on it! Consider them the guest comics for this week. Seriously, check it out. Click the picture, or go <a href="http://deanoemcke.no-ip.org/">here.</p>
<p align="justify">-----</p>
<p align="justify">Crazy Heart, Kick-Ass, and the Room are all great, and I highly suggest them all. They're all hilarious - by which I mean you should watch them when you're high. I would have, but I'm still struggling to find out what larious means. </p>
<p align="justify">-----</p>
<p align="justify">Yep. Sorry for being late. I've been atrociously busy of late. You know what, expect late times for the next month or so. Essays are killing me. (Among other things: viz. alcohol, Two Rivers/Old Toby tabac, and obscure fantasy literature references) </p>
<p align="justify">-----</p>
<p align="justify">I have a new <a href="http://langsoc.eusa.ed.ac.uk/">blog</a>.</p>
<p align="justify">-----</p>
<p align="justify">Well, my promises aren't getting any emptier, because they've already scraped the barrel. Massive apologies for the week hiatus. I need to get this thing automated, and I need to stop falling asleep. I did manage to sell over 100 hoodies on Tuesday, and saw fifteen hundred pounds go through my hands, if that's any consolation. Also, I've prepared three things: an <a href="/comics/079b.png">alternative version</a> of the above comic, a <a href="/unloaded/random/sudoku.png">doodle</a> of something I did to kill time today, and another random <a href="/unloaded/random/necks.png">doodle</a> I made while it was scanning. Enjoy. </p><p align="justify">Anything else happen, you ask? Well, I read three books this weekend. The first was <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Wood_Beyond_the_World">"The Wood Beyond the World"</a>, by William Morris, which I really liked. It was my first Morris book; he is the first true fantasy writer, and has all of the allure of CS Lewis's Narnia and all of the magic of MacDonald, without the christian symbolism. And the language he uses is so quaint, it's almost darling. Then I read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stardust_%28novel%29">"Stardust"</a>, by Neil Gaiman, which was a let down. I don't see why people like his books as much as they do, to be honest. It seemed hastily written, but I enjoyed it, if only for the unpretentious story line. I guess that's alright then. Gives me something to beat. Finally, I read <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Canticle_for_Leibowitz">"A Canticle for Leibowitz"</a>, which won the Hugo, by Miller. This was a fantastic read, really interesting. I'm not sure it said as much as it tried to, but it was particularly enjoyable. I really suggest it. </p><p align="justify">I also watched some films, recently. Gattica was a let down, but I wonder how true that might turn out to be - people are tested and rated and employed based on their DNA and their insurance policies. This was particularly interesting to watch, now that Obama has passed the bill which makes it illegal to deny insurance based on pre-existing medical problems. Julie and Julia was very fun, but I was hungry for the entire film, and not just for the cooking, if you catch my drift. Up in the Air was trite but amusing. And, finally, I really rather enjoyed Away We Go. A particularly delightful film, although I don't have much else to say about it. And that's it, for now.</p></p>
<p align="justify">-----</p>
<p align="justify">Sorry for the lack of an update, yesterday. I do not have wordpress, or otherwise, automation yet, and I have been without internet. My sister got engaged yesterday: all of her friends came to NY, from California and Ohio and elsewhere, and my older sister drove from Washington, I flew from Scotland: we all ended up, completely coincidentally, on the same subway car, with flowers, arranged completely randomly so as to have her meet all of us in turn, with me in the penultimate (I think she was most shocked by that), before the ultimate occurred, and Sam proposed. Then there was the afterparty (Not the mention the preparty I had the night before with Sam, who I only just met.) So, perhaps you can understand and forgive the delay. Here is a small filler. I'll be back up with a new comic on Wednesday. I'll be sure to make it a good one, or a few of them together. Might even work in...dare I say it.... a plot. -Richard</p>
<p align="justify">-----</p>
<p align="justify">Quieter one today. I don't think I'll be loading any on Friday, but I might. I love the word brace. Not much new with me. Spent monday night in the library, pulled an all nighter. Worked. Tired.</p>
<p align="justify">-----</p>
<p align="justify">Monday and Tuesday passed without note. I read a bit. The Long Way, by Bernard Moitessier, is a fantastic book. Why do I love these voyages, I who get seasick and tired of boats almost as soon as I step onto them? </p>
<p align="justify">------</p>
<p align="justify">Sorry for the delay. A quieter comic today. Friday night I went to a party, so I spent Saturday and Sunday quietly reading in bed (or, rather, watching all of Samurai Champloo in bed, which was probably more fun anyway.) Wind from the Sun is an amazing book, and I really suggest it to anyone who reads this little bloggy-bit beneath the comic. Sunday night, after having a really good dinner with some friends, I came home to find my flatmate and two girls drinking. You can imagine where it went from there. I'm not drinking again. This month, anyway...</p>
<p align="justify">------</p>
<p align="justify">Past two days: not much happened. I read Good Omens, by Neil Gaiman and Terry Pratchet, which was alright. Pratchet is a better writer, though, more witty, and it showed. I also bought a new Herodotus (by new, I mean, older version), Snow Country by Kawabata, Sailing Alone Around the World by Slocum, and the Wind from the Sun by Arthur C. Clarke. Looking forward to all of them. Finally, I had a revelation at page 249 in Stand on Zanzibar by John Brunner - the novel is actually good. It took that long for me to realise it. By page 256, I realised that it is actually a work of genius. A mind-staggering work of genius. Can't wait to read more. That's all, folks.</p>
<p align="justify">-----</p>
<p align="justify">Actually, I had a really pleasant morning when I realised that the sun could see into my room again. Besides quoting my own bad poetry at myself, I just sat and was warm for the first time in ages. Not that I did anything different over the past two days. I made cute little buttons for the Facebook Group and my Twitter: they are below. I also managed to somehow drink yet more rum. I am going to see if I can stop for a while. Watched Ten Thins I Hate About You, which is a fabulous movie. Now I find myself once more in love with Julia Stiles... </p>
<p align="justify">-----</p>
<p align="justify">This weekend. Let's see. I got drunk, several times. I wrote the beginning to my new story, and added some more stuff to <a href="/prose/index.html">Prose</a>. I watched Ferris Bueller's day off, for the first time, and liked the idea that everything was just in the kid's mind. I saw a lot of rum go down my gullet. And, most importantly, I finished American Gods, and I got a twitter so I can follow neilhimself. So, yes! Follow me on <a href="http://twitter.com/richfenne">Twitter!</a> I'll update regularly and stuff. </p>
<p align="justify">-----</p>
<p align="justify">As for me, I've started reading American Gods. It's not so bad, the prose could be better. Stole a lot of my ideas, the jerk. I guess I should start pandering to Neil Gaiman fans, he has almost my exact same sense of humor. (I think.) I saw Ponyo yesternight, by the way. It's a brilliant spectacle. Made me dream of the sun, the sea...26.02</p>
<p align="justify">-----</p>
<p align="justify">Well, here's todays. Sorry for it being a bit late. I need to use better paper, the ink bled a bit on this one. Tried to make it as legible as possible, but I'm not sure that I succeeded. Perhaps I should use a font. Takes away some of the je ne se quoi, though, or however you spell that. I don't know, I've never taken French. Concerning the above, I find it weird that both Mishima and Chatwin thought that the image of St. Sebastian being pierced by arrows was incredibly erotic. Maybe I'm missing something, being straight. In other news, it's snowing outside. I went and saw God is an Astronaut on Monday before spending all night in the labs: it was an incredible gig, I couldn't stop contemplating space travel for the entire thing. The three band members were like the trinity, gubernatorially leading us onto the farthest soundscapes and the most burned of retinas. (The lights behind them: my eyes! the light!)</p>
<p align="justify">-----</p>
<p align="justify">Well, that was a short lived ad history. Might put up some project wonderful ads. In other news, above is the first guest comic. I'm not sure it was intended as a guest comic, being a satire (not satyr), but that's irrelevant, because I mostly liked it. So, here it is. There was a wonderful history of facebook comments on it. Kapil drew it. Not much else to report, from me. I saw the Room in the cinema yesterday, one of the more cultured experiences of my life. Truly, a fantastic movie that elevated my thinking for hours. On the other hand, I'm afraid that I might now have breast cancer, and I cannot find any of my spoons. - 21.02 Richard</p>
<p align="justify">-----</p>
<p align="justify">Well, here's one for all of the Na'vi people checking out the site these days. If you didn't know, go look at the Na'vi page below to find some cool documents. As for what it says above, some quick translation should do it rather well. I blame David Leon for enlightening me to the fact that Jake Sully is basically a MMORPG player who gets the chance to actually marry that perfect girl in the game. Bastard. Neytiri is the only character I've ever felt jealous of: to think that she smiled at every other guy in the cinema... - 19.02.2010 Richard </p>
<p align="justify">-----</p>
<p align="justify">So, here's an actual comic, with some thought put in it. I have them stocked up until the week after next, which is rather nice. Someone is already buying one of the shirts [the french pretentious one], which is nice - I can also do custom orders, of course, and there is any colour available. Simon is working hard on the site [beats me why], and we may have comment function on later. I also have one guest comic planned, since I found out he made a satire of the site. Expect that up at some point. Word up. -17.02.2009 Richard</p>
<p align="justify">-----</p>
<p align="justify">Well, I've been working on the site a bit. I've updated the <a href="/poetry/index.html">poetry section</a>, added a few more scribbles. I've also added a <a href="/prose/index.html"?>prose section</a>, and I've added a significant amount of work in there. Finally, some people have expressed interest in t-shirts, so I've added a <a href="/merch/index.html">merchandise page.</a> Here's the first comic of the decade. I'll aim for three a week - no promises. Looks like we might have comments and RSS feed automatically soon, thanks to my friend Simon. Good times.  - 16.02.2010 Richard</p>
<p align="justify">-----</p>
<p align="justify">So, I don't believe I'll have the time to update with a comic three times a week, as before. However, I will occasionally be loading images. What I will be doing more often with this site is uploading writing, I believe. I find that I have a greater faculty for work if I think that there might be an audience, somewhere. As such, I've uploaded a <a href="http://www.burntfen.net/poetry/newpoems.html">few more pages of work</a>, some of it unfinished. Feel free to email richfenne at gmail with comments, until I get some sort of commenting ability set up for each page. Also, I've changed the image up there currently, to show what happens when I give up on a bad comic idea. Enjoy. :D </p>
<p align="justify">-----</p>
 <p align="justify">Well, guys, I've had a good run. Rather than load a few more comics, I've decided to end it now. Partly because I haven't felt any great ideas the past week or so, partly because the computer lab was shut down and there weren't any scanners, but mostly because I have been feeling like this is a chapter of my life that is drawing to an end [or not drawing, really.] You see, in one week or so, on September 1st, I will be heading off into the wild for a year, and will have no computer, no drawing paper, no scanner, no camera, no internet. I am going to go hiking. Two months in Europe, and then the Appalachian and Pacific Crest Trail. And so, alas, this is it. I've really done more than I thought. I kept this comic running, with only three fillers for a day each, for six months straight. Over sixty-five comics. A readership that peaked at 113 in one day, with over 100 of you guys checking in over ten times a month, wiht over 5k pageviews. That was really fantastic.This was mostly a project to see if I could undertake a long-term project, and I am amazed that it paid off. Thanks to everyone, and I mean everyone, every single reader, who gave me support and kept coming. You guys have been great. I hope you all have enjoyed it as much as I have.</p>
  
  <p align="justify">For those of you who would like to know why and where I am going, email me at richfenne at gmail dot com. For the others, all the best. You may have noticed that the archives are named 'Genesis.' Who knows, after this year of Exodus coming, where I will certainly be writing, I may open up a new chapter for you all. :) </p>
  <p align="justify">---</p>
 <p align="justify">Sorry. Hiked 9 miles on sunday, my first two Munros. Worked today, then went and saw Mummy 3. Don't see it, it is horrible, for a variety of reasons. Saw a standup, which was also horrible. Nothing else to report. Will have a new comic up when I can, which may be on monday. - Richard</p>
 <p align="justify">---</p>
 <p align="justify">Work. Been doing stuff. Saw my flatmate for a bit. Fell in love again. It won't wash out. - Richard</p>
 <p align="justify">---</p>
 <p align="justify">Work work work work work. Saw my flatmate's play. Was good. Saw a stand up. Was good. [He stood up.] - Richard</p>
 <p align="justify">---</p>
 <p align="justify">Worked thirteen hours today. Yesterday, I saw an amazing play, one of the best I have seen (if not the best), Women of Troy. The actors were among the audience, and I felt truly moved. I can't praise it enough. I also saw the Princess Bride. I worked a litte amount, and went to a flat party, where I stayed up all night, unlike those who fell asleep, as the self-appointed DJ. My music finally fit the mood. It was fantastic. I also properly asked a girl to a movie-date for the first time ever (denied), apologised to my ex (why?), and made friends with a gay guy. Night: success. -Richard </p>
 <p align="justify">---</p>
 <p align="justify">Finally finishted Dostoevesky's Idiot. Was ok. Dragged. As did Koyaanqatsi - but the cinematography was fantastic enough to carry you through, not to mention Philip Glass's music. Although now I am incredibly depressed about the state of the world and worried about the Hopi prophecies again. Reminds me of the time my dad told me not to worry about college debt because the whole system was going to go under soon. Thanks dad. References in the country comic are on the previous page. Here is today's. I've been using Tuesday and <a href="http://machall.com/view.php?date=2003-03-10">Thursday</a> for years... - Richard</p>
<p align="justify">---</p>
<p align="justify">Monday I worked 13 hours with an hour break. I didn't have a chance to get a better upload. Today I only worked ten hours, so here is a long comic to make up for it. I tried to fit in as many bad puns and jokes, and I mean bad, as I could. See if you can get them all. The last panel references the awesome Kate Beaton. Check out her <a href="http://beatonna.livejournal.com/">comic</a>. I'll leave a note explaining how bad the puns are later. Out. - Richard on August 6th</p>
<p align="justify">---</p>
<p align="justify">Friday I had off. I went to the store, and I bought new boots, worth quite a bit, along with a mat, sleeping bag liner (silk), bowl, blister stuff, insoles. I decided to watch some movies. So I did: Dan in Real Life, which I could barely watch. I am very, very easy to embarass by watching things, I sympathize to the extreme, and it took me a good extra hour to watch because I kept pausing it. Finally I caught on and just jammed on my Ukulele when I couldn't take it anymore. Charlie Wilson's War was next, an awesome documentar-film/film of how the US funded the Mujahadeen, based around the Texan senator Charlie Wilson. Then I watched Big Fish, which is a fantastic movie about story telling, I really liked it even thouygh I didn't like the era. Then, at two, I drew comics and started The Hours, a brilliant, brilliant movie that is very deep and good. I've been wanting to see if proper for years. Then I went to bed. </p>
  <p align="justify">In the morning, I went and traded my boots for other, better ones, did stuff, bought food, and watched The Shawshank Redpemtion, which is the best movie. (Period.) It was a good few days off. Today I worked all day. It mostly sucked. The Library has been closed the past two days, so this comic is a photograph that's been photoshoped. I'll get a higher-quality scan later. Oh! Big news: My friend Jacob is walking the PCT with me! I am very, very excited and happy. I can't wait. Out. - Richard August 3</p>
  <p align="justify">---</p>
  <p align="justify">Wall-E was Ok, but I couldn't take the scientific errors. Clarke would have had a paroxysm. Besides that, I worked. Locked myself out of my flat for two hours. Started running again. - Richard</p>
<p align="justify">---</p>
<p align="justify">I saw Dark Knight. I still don't like Batman, but the movie was pure awesome. Heath Ledger better be the hell in Valhalla. I watched half of Snow White and the Seven Dwarves before I deleted it. Not a good film. - Richard</p>
<p align="justify">---</p>
<p align="justify">Right. The weekend. Firefly, Welcome to the NHK. The Black Cauldron, a quality film, but a bit too meandering. And then work, and more work. Reading. Not much else to say, really. I played Guitar Hero for the first time the other day. It was good. Death Can for Cutie has a new album out, which I haven't listened to yet, still on Sigur Ros. -Richard</p>
<p align="justify">---</p>
<p align="justify">So. I had the last two days off. I saw Mamma Mia! in theatres, which was surprisingly good. (I am not gay, though.) The main girl is very attractive, and I might mean Meryl Streep. I also saw Sirens and Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas, both again, both deleted afterwards. They're just not very good films. A film I did really like was Atonement, which I thought was brilliantly done. The cinematography carried one through the first half, the plot through the second. I read 'Phantom Islands of the Atlantic', which was a pretty fascinating read, as well as the poems of Edward Thomas, delightfully bucolic though they were. I started the Eddas, but stopped because I want to read them in the original Icelandic, and I don't have the time. I also started translating 'The Seafarer' again, from the Old English, and I am now reading 'The Idiot', still, 'In Patagonia' by Chatwick, C. Day Lewis' translation of the Aeneid, the Cantos of Ezra Pound, and Ulysses. It's a wonder I have time to sleep. - Richard July 25th</p>
 <p align="justify">---</p>
 <p align="justify">Sorry about the late update. I just clean forgot. Scanning more today. Been working the past two days, although I did manage to see 'Wag the Dog' (1994), with De Niro and Dustin Hoffman, a brilliantly prophetic film of the spin on the Iraq war and the Monica Lewinski scandal. I watched 'Three Days of the Condor' (1974) after that, an even more precognizant film with Robert Redford, which forsaw the CIA absuing civil liberties for the sake of the search for oil. Very good. I suggest both of them. Did I mention Wag the Dog had Willie Nelson? Speaking of Willie Nelson, go out and listen to 'Highwaymen', a song by the eponymous supergroup, formed with Willie Nelson, Johnny Cash, and two other non-specifics I can't remember. It's good. Out. -Richard</p>
  <p align="justify">---</p>
  <p align="justify">The fourth panel is Latin. The alt-text is the Old Testament. The best thing I watched this weekend was Dr. Horrible's Sing-Along-Blog, which is now off the internet, but was a short movie that totally rocked, about a villian's rise to supervilliany. It was really good, I can't stop singing the songs. Joss Whedon made it, which explains why it was awesome. Josh made me see it: cheers. Besides that, I watched the 3D 'Journey to the Center of the Earth,' which was brilliant and made me want an Icelandic girlfriend again. I've always loved the old movie, and this one was suitably good for today. I also watched 'All the President's Men', again with Robert Redford, describing the Watergate scandal. Yesterday I watched Shadowlands, about CS Lewis - It was also good. I went to a flat party, wrote more, slept...and worked all day today. I am tired. - Richard</p>
<p align="justify">---</p>
<p align="justify">Yeah this one ain't so great. Moving on. Watched 'Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid' today. Amazing film about two western outlaws. Also watched 'The Way We Were', which had Robert Redford as well, and Barbara Streisand. Yesterday I saw some more 'Welcome to the NHK', which is a good anime, unlike 'Angel Sanctuary', which I watched an episode of today before I deleted it. I went and saw 'Forbidden Kingdom' yesterday, which somehow imitated seriously and yet made fun of Kung Fu films. I like it a ton, mostly because Kung Fu is awesome, but also because of the inevitable pretty chinese girl.</p>
  <p align="justify">I saw through my first stereogram this morning, which I am proud of, and I read some more of Ezra Pound's Cantos. They speak for themselves. I also worked and made dinner for a friend. I lead a busy life it seems. Current Music: Fleet Foxes, the EP, Radiohead's 'In Rainbow's second CD, the music to Sharpe, and Sigur Ros's new album. I suggest all and sundry. Oh! I learned that the Finn's used to use peas as currency. Weird. The drawing below is of my friend Simon. He's got a brutally awesome mustache. The quote is mine, it doesn't make much sense. I probably shouldn't put drawings that are better than my comics on the same page. Might give people false standards. - Richard on July 17th</p>
  <p align="justify">---</p>
  <p align="justify">Not much to say. Worked two ten hour days. Tired.</p>
 <p align="justify">---</p>
 <p align="justify">Worked all Friday, and spent today and yesterday reading Gene Wolfe's 'The Wizard Knight', which is quite possibly one of the best told stories, not books or literature, but stories, I have ever read. Took me around 20 hours to read in less than three days, and I didn't regret a bit of it. - Richard July 14</p>
 <p align="justify">---</p>
 <p align="justify">Why is the art so much better for this comic? Because it is my fiftieth. Woo. Go me. I've passed a minute and meaningless milestone. For those of you who haven't been paying incredible attention, there is a hidden page on this site, and has been since I made it, which quotes the latin from Tacitus concerning the Fenni. (Try and find it. I dare you.) So this is my comic for that. Sorry if the text is a bit small, this took a lot of work. Around an hour a panel, which is why I don't do it this detailed normally.<br />
    <br />
  I saw Kung-Fu Panda, and it was pretty good. I liked it. Other than that, I've just been working. But I have had time to finish that vignette, so here is a link: <a href="http://www.burntfen.net/poetry/voluptuary.html">The Voluptuary</a> is the title. I rather like it. Enjoy, everyone. Here's to the next 18 or so comics before I close this chapter. - Richard, July 10th</p>
 <p align="justify">---</p>
 <p align="justify">I watched 'O Brother Where Art Thou' again, which was lovely. What a great movie. I also wrote part of a short vignette, I'll put it up here when I finish it, which won't be for a while, because the next four days are solid work for me. Although tomorrow I will go see Kung Fu Panda. I also finished 'Peace' by Gene Wolfe. I'm not sure how much I enjoyed it, but I know I did. - Richard, July 8th</p>
<p align="justify">---</p>
<p align="justify">I have been working a lot. WOW! I am cracking. Just saw Emperor's New Groove (always a fantastic movie) and Into the Wild again. Darjeeling Limited on Saturday. Not much else. I lost the bookshop job. I am content with this. More comics coming. </p>
<p align="justify">---</p>
<p align="justify">Right. Apologies for the bad art in panel two, and for the filler comic. Moving on. I saw Hancock, which wasn't as bad as I thought it was going to be. 'In Search of a Midnight Kiss' is a really fantastic movie, completely superb. Been working a lot, not much else going on. I may have a project in the works soon, more on that later. Thinking about moving the comment feature to the front page. Yea? Nay? - Richard</p>
<p align="justify">---</p>
<p align="justify">I was looking over the crap comic filler I had put up today, and it really wasn't good enough. So here's my doodles from some Linguistics class, on a piece of the Student newspaper. The first comic I made is hidden in here, not including the ones I did in highschool. This was the comic that made me think: "Hey, maybe I should do a comic. Or maybe not." Anyway, enjoy it, and sorry to all the dissapointed masses who expected an actual comic today. I didn't have the time to scan the past few days, as I have been working a bit too much, and last night my coworkers thought it fit to show me how little it takes to make me completely wasted. - Richard</p>
<p align="justify">---</p>
<p align="justify">I saw Radiohead on Friday. PHUCKING AMAZING. The best show, ever, despite the rain. Except for the Glasgwegians, a perfect night. I also watched more Sharpe and saw Prince Caspian in theatres, where I was outraged that they made a romance out of Susan and Caspian (although, secretly, I was only outraged because I wasn't Caspian.) That's two botchings of Narnia - the next five will be interesting. They seem to have made the Telmarines into hispanic Persians. Not much more to say. Another 12-hour work day tomorrow.  - Richard on June 29th</p>
    <p align="justify">---</p>
    <p align="justify">The above is an actual note. I wrote it at the Hive the other night. What a drunk. I know it is a direct quote because I didn't give it to her - found out she had a boyfriend first, strangely enough from a guy who recognized me as the Citideli boy. I feel like quoting Neil Gaiman a lot: I am not a shopboy, just a boy who happens to work in a shop. As for me, I am fine. i worked eleven hours today, at three jobs. I also obtained the bookstore job I wanted: hoorah! I had to spend a large amount of money on another, smaller Greek New Testament (I'm not even christian, why.) and a first edition of Tolkien's book, Smith of Wooten Major, which is my favourite of all of his works. I won't spoil it: find it yourself, and good luck. Yesterday I watched Rain Man, which was very good, and Idiocracy, an interesting movie about a dumber future. I finished 'No Passport to Tibet' tonight, a gem of a book, about a travel in the early 1900s through Tibet (not, as would be assumed, Peru.) Not much else going on - oh, yeah, going to see Radiohead tomorrow in Glasgow. It is going to kick some serious mule. - Richard</p>
    <p align="justify">---</p>
  <p align="justify">Work. Watched more Anime. Drank more whiskey. I added an information section. See below for details. - Richard</p>
  <p align="justify">---</p>
  <p align="justify">Watched more Sharpe. Worked. Bought 'Peace' by Gene Wolfe. Watched the English Patient again, a beautiful movie. 'For the heart is an organ of fire.' That movie knows it's Heroditus. For sure. -Richard</p>
  <p align="justify">---</p>
  <p align="justify">For the record, I liked the swinging monkeys. That is mainly because I gave up caring around the refrigerator scene. Not working at the bookstore. Unfortunate. Just finished 'The Extraordinary Voyage of Pytheas the Greek', a fantastic book about a 5th century BC Massaliot. I suggest it to all and sundry who are interested in ancient west Mediterranean trade or the ancient British isles. Also, the band <a href="http://www.myspace.com/fleetfoxes">Fleet Foxes</a> are amazing. I'm not sure about <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sTwEVq6VtgA">Jabba on the Dais</a>, though. - Richard on  June 19th.</p>
  <p align="justify">---</p>
  <p align="justify">Go here: <a href="http://www.buttercupfestival.com">Buttercup Festival</a>. Go there now. You'll understand when you do. (That's me you'll see, you see?) -Richard</p>
  <p align="justify">---</p>
  <p align="justify">Watched Waterloo and Gladiator. Waterloo is interesting, but too long. And I went to the theatres to watch Mongol, which is long but deservedly so. Brilliant movie, although Graeme complained it did not have enough gore. Translated Catullus 1. And played some more Lord of the Rings Trading Card Games - It is very sad that they stopped producing it, they should have pulled stock out of the Silmarillion. I'd like a Melian of Doriath card: she was one saucy maia, or so I hear. -Richard</p>
  <p align="justify">---</p>
  <p align="justify">Not much new. I might have a job at a bookstore I just found, which is quite possibly one of the best stores I have seen. I recently bought a Greek New Testament and Dr. Zhivago, there, and am currently saving up for a first edition 'Smith of Wooton Major', which is, in my honest opinion, the best Tolkien story. Which is why today's comic is concerning the bastards who point out an alleged plot-hole. All know, however, that Gwaihir, as a servant of Manwe, is far to proud to carry petty rings... -Richard</p>
  <p align="justify">---</p>
  <p align="justify">This is a reference to an Ezra Pound poem, naturally. I recently finished both 'The Best of Edward Abbey', which was brilliant, as usual, and 'Hiroshima', by John Hersey, which was incredibly depressing. I have been taking long walks. That is all. -Richard</p>
  <p align="justify">---</p>
  <p align="justify">Sorry about the late posting. I went running at around midnight and clean forgot to update. I like the above comic: mostly because I finally figured out how to do borders on Photoshop, but also because I just like drawing old men with eyepatches and beards. It is a reference to an early Yeats poem. King Goll himself was a one-eye, I hear. The line particular that I am referring to is &quot;They will not stop, the leaves a'flutter around me, the beech leaves old.&quot; As for me, not much new. Been busy living. Watched Jeremiah Johnson last night: a brilliant film about a mountain man. Truly awesome. -Richard</p>
  <p align="justify">---</p>
  <p align="justify">Well, not much new. Today I bought and finished 'A Walk in the Woods' by Bill Bryson. I then checked some blogs: it looks like I will not be going South Bound on the Appalachian trail, but rather North Bound. I plan to begin in around January, then quickly jaunt across to Arizona. Oh well. This gives me time to go to Greece. Horray! I also bought 'The Wizard Knight', by Gene Wolfe. I will read it as soon as I finish my other books. </p>
  <p align="justify">---<br />
  </p>
  <p align="justify">Anything else new? Today I finished a succesful half-way around the Meadows run. I got three new shirts in the mail: one from the esteemed <a href="http://www.buttercupfestival.com">Buttercup Festival</a>, the best comic since Calvin and Hobbes, one from <a href="http://www.katebeaton.com">Kate Beaton</a> comics (Her 'Fat Napolean' comic is brilliant hilarious, we don't know why), and one from <a href="http://www.asofterworld.com">A Softer World</a>. All shirts came from the guy who just restarted the <a href="http://www.wigu.com/">Wigu</a> comic. Go check it out, I rather enjoy it. -RF, June 4.08</p>
  <p align="justify">---</p>
  <p align="justify">Sorry for the delay today. I slept in, as I stayed up all night hanging out with people. It was highly enjoyable, for me, but I always win at Goldeneye, so maybe it wasn't for them. I spent most of yesterday looking up word etymologies for words I didn't quite know perfectly: if anyone wants the list, I'll put it up. Besides that, life continues as normal. Looking for a new job. And, to clarify, if any nation finds out that you have joined the French Foreign, they take away your citizenship. -Richard 6.2.08</p>
<p align="justify">---</p>
<p align="justify">I am working in the deli again. Can't be helped. I finished 'Borneo' - it was good, a bit anticlimatic. I restarted the Book of the New Sun, rememorized some poetry, am still getting through Into the Wild again, started Ulysses, watched some more anime, and attempted to write some prose (complete failure. Ended up with a blog entry.) Working on some better art. Nothing else to report. If you're here from Three Panel Soul: awesome.</p>
<p align="justify">---</p>
<p align="justify">Well, I've updated the site now. It has taken some time, and for that I apologise. My computer went down, and then I was lazy, but it's over, so whatever. What have I been doing, recently? Nothing of note. I have tried, so far unsucessfully, to get a steady job that won't kill me. I watched 300 for the first time: I don't know how I feel about it. On the one hand, pretty nice filming. On the other hand, so, so, so historically wrong, which matters to me. I saw Master and Commander again yesterday, which is and will remain a rather good movie, despite the best intentions of Russell Crowe to make it otherwise. Today I watched half of Blue Harvest, the Family Guy Star Wars spoof, before I gave up and turned it off. It just wasn't very amusing, for some reason.</p>
<p align="justify">So I abandoned myself to my book - currently, 'Into the Heart of Borneo' by Redmond O'Hanlon. I suggest it to all and sundry. A lovely account of a trek through the jungle in search of... that great nameless rhinocerous: adventure, knowledge, and the like. I recently devoured 'The Devil in a Forest', an old fashioned semi-historical robin-hoodesque novel by Gene Wolfe. I find, while being the brilliant writer of the New Sun series, as well as Latro in the Mist, he does spend too much time putting in details about his worlds. He knows everything, and that shows too often. It distracts. Then again, I refence everything, and that distracts as well. Therefore, in today's comic, there is no reference. And I'll leave you with that, until Wednesday. (Although I must suggest to you Bonobo's 'Animal Magic' album, which I am currently listening to.) - Richard 05.26.2008</span></p>
<p align="justify">---</p>
<p align="justify">Sorry about the lack of updates to the previous pages. I've been busy doing things recently. Trying to find a job that pays, not that this one doesn't (ha!). I am also trying to write more, rather than just think and waste away. -Richard 4.23.08</p>
<p align="justify">---</p>
<p align="justify">Well, here is Will's comic he was promised. If you want another comic that actually has a bad drawing of Reese, look <a href="https://www.burntfen.com/comic/comics/026b.png">here</a>. Not much else to say. Computer still down. I am sleeping in my tent in my room. It just feels nice. Later dudes. - Richard 4.????.08</p>
<p align="justify">---</p>
<p align="justify">Sorry about the delay. I decided to go spend the night in a cave on the beach in Berwick-upon-Tweed. It was worth it.</p>
<p align="justify">---</p>
<p align="justify">Well, my computer decided to die yesterday in the middle of Fantasia. So I am doing this long-hand, basically, without Dreamweaver. Until I get the computer fixed, which may be a while, there will be minimum updates: meaning probably just this page. It's a ram compatibility issue: apparently, having the wrong ram in my machine can ruin it, even when I remove the bad ram. Really sucks. Not as much as the Greek examination I am going to have today, which may decide how much of my life I have wasted or not (just like every exam). Not looking forward to it. Oh well. Enjoy the comic. If you came here from Questionable Content (I have ads up sometimes), welcome. Anyway. Later dudes. -Richard 5.12.08</p>
<p align="justify">---</p>
<p align="justify">Good response on the buttons (none on the email, for some reason. Maybe I should put a link to that somewhere. Like here: richfenne at gmail.) I will change them when I am done with my exam. As for studying - well, it has been very nice out. And nothing is better than playing frisbee in the sun with two guys and an asian girl. No, I mean nothing. And sorry for the lame comics this week. I'm a work in progress. Or regress. Some sort of gress. - Richard 5.9.08</p>
<p align="justify">---</p>
<p align="justify">Since I have not much to say today, <a href="https://www.burntfen.com/comic/minutiae/sailing_background.jpg">here</a> is a background I made for myself the other month. Enjoy. Also, note the new buttons I have for the archive pages, and the links above. There are more up for display <a href="https://www.burntfen.com/comic/comics/022.html">here</a>. Tell me what you think, please. :) -Richard 5.7.08</p>
<p align="justify">---</p>
<p align="justify">Apparently I can't spell Teiresias either. Apologies. Also, since people keep complaining, I am going to start explaining the reference in each comic. There is generally one or two. Not here, though: go to the actual comic page, by pressing prior and then next. Not much else is new. I was messing around with javascript, got a cool reflection thing I found online working. Might show it to you guys sometime. I installed Windows XP (The horror! The horror!) on my Lenovo again, since I miss Age of Empires. I tried to install Ubuntu off of a CD and it royally destroyed my partition of windows, so I had to reinstall again. I've lost some faith in Ubuntu, no matter what Randall may say (not really, it's a brilliant OS that everyone should use at some point.) Watched Supertroopers yesterday, was good. Went clubbing for the first time in a year, remembered why I don't go clubbing. And once again failed to revise. I did learn a lot of cool things, today, though, so I think I might start a cool-fact-a-day list. Since I didn't have enough to do online already anyway. The whole premise of this website is based on the idea that some people visit and are interested, so why not. By the way, we've hit 1,000 page views since I started counting. And yet yesterday was an all-time low at 4 users hitting. Awesome. Maybe someday...then again, I don't expect much with comics like this weeks. This and the next two strips will each feature the word 'dick'. Apologies. -Richard 5.4.08</p>
<p align="justify">---</p>
<p align="justify">Comic is late today, I was out watching Alien and Spirited Away, neither of which I had seen before. The latter is excellent. I am not sure about the first. Was a good time, however. And now more revision. PS. Man do I feel stupid. I had the prophet written as Sophocles for days, and showed people. When I clearly meant Tiresius. And no one told me. Aaaah. Well, at least I caught it eventually. - Richard 5.2.08</p>
<p align="justify">---</p>
<p align="justify">Not much to report this week. If you didn't catch it, I added a Links page. I haven't been waking up in time. I've been watching films, though. The Rise and Rise of Michael Rimmer is brilliant. Much better than Crocodile Dundee. - Richard 4.30.08</p>
<p align="justify">---</p>
<p align="justify">Well, one examination is over, until I get the grade back, at least. One more to go. As for things in general, everyone says that I clearly get my inspiration from XKCD. I disagree: I've been drawing in this style for years, and I think I have been far more influenced by that greatest of comics, Calvin and Hobbes, followed closely after by Mac Hall and then Buttercup Festival. So...pah. XKCD is great, but I find it lacks something - every strip ends with a quick 'heh, that's it then', and you don't necesarily think further. Which is what I try to do with this comic, anyway. This strip isn't a good example. I have also added a Links page. I read too many comics. And, finally, <a href="http://www.inktank.com">Inktank</a> is back! used to be a brilliant strip, I expect nothing less of the new one. Should be good. Richard - 4.28.08</p>
<p align="justify">---</p>
<p align="justify">I have been pretty busy with examinations this week, meaning I have been busy trying to justify not studying by watching more My Name is Earl. Good thing I do comics a few weeks in advance. Also, I will not be in Edinburgh next year. I am taking the year out to travel and whatnot. Expect a long hiatus, starting September 1st or so. - Richard 4.24.08</p>
<p align="justify">---</p>
<p align="justify">I have added a comment box and page, accessible beneath the image. It's for any comment: if you want to comment on any particular comic, facebook works. There are more poems I have loaded. I have also added a way to donate to feed me and my comic addiction. If you do donate over $5, I will draw whatever you want. Guaranteed. In a most likely better style than my normal comics. Link is next to the copyright info. However, see enclosed documents for details. As for Will, donating $0.14 before I managed to get the $5 rule - you will get your comic. Oh yes. - Richard 4.14.08 </p>
<p align="justify">---</p>
<p align="justify">So I have drawn more stuff. Hoorah. I have almost nothing else to report. I might not be at university next year, which would influence the publication of this webcomic. Yes. -Richard</p>
<p align="justify">---</p>
<p align="justify">So, I decided to waste this sunday by watching the first three Star Wars films back to back. I have composed this picture to show how much I like Anakin. It is available <a href="https://www.burntfen.com/comic/minutiae/anakin.jpg">here</a>. That is all. - Richard April 6th, 2008</p>
<p align="justify">---</p>
<p align="justify">I've changed the name of this comic! It is no longer Dragon Ash, due to me not wanting to get into copyright issues with a Japanese Hip Hop Band (of all of the things I could have chosen to vie with, that was a good choice.) It shall henceforth be called &quot;<span class="style2">The Burnt Fen Maunderings</span>.&quot; It's a bit of a deal, but I should have done my homework. Now I've run into interesting issues: what to call my comic? Dragon Coal, Coke, Embers, Char - all sprang to mind, but I don't particularly like the sound as much. So I went back to the phragmites roots, and found out that 'fenne' is Old Frisian (an awesome language, if only for the name) for 'fen'. Burnt Marsh, Marsh Coal, Marsh Arsh - again, more to mind. I thought I had hit the clov on the ham when I ran into Fen-Fire and Ignis Fatuus - Two names for Will of the Wisps. But those are taken elsewhere, and again, I don't want to run into copyright issues. Of course, the sound of the word 'fen' is why I chose the name in the first place, among other reasons: probably one of my favourite sounding words, along with 'fell', which also has a variety of meanings. So I decided not to go for variants, like slough (too much Bunyan, too little onion) or bog - so fen. And, having wiki'd Burnt Fen, I ran across <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burnt_Fen">an article</a>, which claims that &quot;Burnt Fen is said to take its name from having been burnt by Hereward the Wake.&quot; That is pretty much the most awesome awesome ever. I mean, a fen that has been burnt down (note the signifigance in burnt: has to deal with both 'couk,' inherent in .co.uk, and the actually meaning for 'fenne', being, of course, 'dragon') by a guy who's surname is only 'the Wake,' from whom some Robin Hood stories are drawn, an Anglo Saxon outlaw and opposition leader. That is exactly the vein I was looking for. So, I've called it Burnt Fen.</p>
<p align="justify">Why 'Maunderings?' Well, I want this comic to wander, to deal with many issues I find relevant to life, mostly humorous, but also to cover depression, love, and most of all, history and nature. As a young child, wandering in or near marshes was one of my favourite things to do. 'To maunder' is the perfect word for this: it means to talk in a rambling, foolish, or meaningless way, as well as to wander aimlessly and confused. I also love the progressive form, and the definite article, so, The Burnt Fen Maunderings it is. If you want, call it Burnt Fen - I don't mind. Call it Dragon Ash, if you like. Don't bother me none. I am content. Now I have to change the banner, a bit of text, and probably create a new facebook group. Well, that's life. I also hope you enjoy the comic. That's important. If you ever don't, let me know. Cya round. - Richard 4.4.2008</p>

<p align="justify">Decided to put up a colored version instead of a new comic today. Anyone like it? I now have a shiny banner. It might be too black. Also, contact me online at aim: bohemianbynature or msn: richard dot littauer at gmail. Online chat explains away boredom. People have started to use the facebook profile as a means to comment on individual comics, which is cool. Working on cooler things, like javascript and css. Hoorah! - Richard 32.3.2008</p>

<p align="justify">Well, if you haven't noticed, I've moved to updates on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday. So look back in the archives, there might be more you've missed. Also, sigur rós is awesome. Go on the IRC channel sometime, it's mighty cool, on the server ircnet.demon.co.uk. #sigur-ros. I've also added an 'Other Work' archive, for those of you who like reading bad poetry. An RSS feed is now available. The link to it is below: publication might be a bit spotty for a while. Nothing else to report. - Richard 28.3.08</p>

<p align="justify">And so begins Fenn Couk, as in the vernacular, Dragon Ash; a webcomic so behind even it's name is obsolete. Currently above: Comic #1. Woo. All those who point out that coke is more precisely the solid residue of impure carbon obtained from bituminous coal and other carbonaceous materials after removal of volatile material by destructive distillation, which is quite more precise than 'ash', will be shot. Anyone who then comments that 'dragon' isn't really a good adjective will be deported to the Yukon. And probably shot again.</p>
<p align="justify">There is also now a Facebook group.  The group is called &quot;The Dragon Ash Webcomic.&quot; Join, tell people who might be interested, or bore your enemies by inviting them all and then cleverly not mentioning it again.</p>
<p align="justify"> Updated biweekly, on mondays and fridays, when I get around to it. Updates may eventually become triweekly, depending on the amount of time I spend staring at nothing. If you would like to pester the author, please email richfenne at gmail dot com. In the meantime, I suggest these other webcomics below. Cheers. -Richard. March 17th, 2008 </p>
